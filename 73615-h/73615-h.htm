<h2 class="nobreak" id="TRANSLATORS_PREFACE">TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p>The translator of Ritter’s “Geographical Studies,”
which has received in its English dress the hearty greeting
of our most cultured scholars, takes a renewed pleasure
in giving to the students of our higher Seminaries a
second volume from the pen of the great Geographer.
The former work, addressed, as its contents mainly were,
to the members of the Royal Academy of Berlin, was too
recondite in thought and too abstruse and elaborate in
statement ever to become, whether in German or in
English, a popular work; but the present volume—the
bright, compact crystal of Ritter’s life—will pass into a
general circulation, and will be recognized as not merely
a simple and perfectly intelligible treatise, but as a masterly
application of the comparative method of Geography,
and as philosophical as it is practical and interesting.</p>

<p>Besides the voluminous Erdkunda, which deals almost
exclusively with Asia, and treats it with an exhaustive
fullness, Ritter has left the world the volume already referred
to, and three courses of Academical Lectures. One
of these courses is now before the reader; one of the remaining
two relates to the geography of Europe, and the
other to the history of Geographical Science and of Discovery.
Of these three courses, a distinguished American
scholar<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> has said: “Free from excessive details, systematic,
clear, bold, and fresh, they are better fitted to bring up to
the mind Ritter, the university instructor, than all his other
writings.” This praise is by no means excessive; and the
student who shall, with the assistance of a good physical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
atlas, go through this work, will find himself master of a
far larger number of special facts than the size of the
volume would indicate; and also of a <i>science</i> of Geography,
which subsidizes all detail, and makes it auxiliary
to the comprehension of relations no less beautiful and
singular than are revealed in the study of the other departments
of Nature.</p>

<p>The peculiar difficulties attending the translation of the
Geographical Studies have not been met in this volume;
in the University lecture-room, Ritter’s style, which, before
the Royal Academy, was extremely involved, poetical
and inexhaustive, became simple, straightforward, and
luminous. In style, Ritter carried neglect to the point
of slovenliness; and the finish which Humboldt cultivated
so assiduously, he rejected as unworthy of a true scholar.
The highly figurative words with which he used so liberally
to decorate his writings, I have generally had to render
with a rather too bare fidelity to a prose style; for grateful
and captivating as they were to his German hearers,
they would look over-fanciful to an English reader, and
obscure rather than illustrate the thought. It has been
my earnest purpose to make this work fill a great void in
our educational literature; and its convenient size gives it
an incomparable advantage over the voluminous works of
Sir John Herschel and Mrs. Somerville; while in rigid
philosophical precision, in method, in natural growth—not
to use that inevitable German word <i>development</i>,
(Entwickelung)—even those eminent geographers would,
doubtless, award it the palm.</p>

<p>The demands of the public may yet render needful the
translation of other of Ritter’s works; meanwhile, the
editor of this work purposes to prepare a biography of
that great man, whose memory all his pupils revere, and
whose life was not less beautiful to his friends than it was
fruitful and valuable to the whole scientific world.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

</div>

<p>The subject of these lectures is Geography in its most enlarged
and comprehensive sense. It will be necessary to preface them
with some general observations, which shall serve to indicate the
scientific basis on which the discussion will rest. Our starting-point
will be with Nature herself and not with arbitrary geographical
systems hitherto constructed.</p>

<p>By the word Nature will be meant the entire Creation. The
grasping of Nature in all its objects and all its forces becomes, in
conjunction with the agency of Time and Space, the comprehension
of a great system. The inanimate creation may be represented
under the term inorganic, the animate creation under the
term organic. Yet there is not an absolute contrast between them;
for in both there is ceaseless progress, no pause, but in a higher
and comprehensive sense a cosmical life, the whole forming one
great Organism, in which the inorganic world, so called, is only
the foundation on which the animate creation stands.</p>

<p>To us, our own Earth is the most marked feature of Nature
viewed on its inorganic side. To us it is the planet best known of
all, or rather the only one closely known, the point whence we
draw conclusions on the whole Universe, the resting ground for
the glass that searches the Kosmos, to use Humboldt’s word,
discerning the place which the Earth holds in it, and prying into
the mysteries of the entire creation. Our globe is one of the
major planets of our system, all of which gird the sun with great
elliptic orbits, midway in which is our own. There begins the first
popular division of the planets,—those that are within and those
which are without our own orbit. This is one of the most simple of
discriminations, one which we inherit from the ancients in an unmodified
form. Humboldt retains this primary classification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span></p>

<p>The external planets are those whose orbits embrace that of the
Earth within their own. The minor planets are those whose orbits
are embraced by that of the Earth. These are Mercury and Venus.</p>

<p>The ancients, counting both the sun and moon, reckoned only
seven planets. At the end of the eighteenth century another was
added, Uranus, an external planet. Through the instrumentality
of improved telescopes, soon after, four minor ones were discovered,
Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta; and by the still more perfect
lenses recently introduced, and the assiduity and skill of astronomers,
the number of these little planetary bodies, ranging between
the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, has grown great. Beyond Saturn
and Uranus is Neptune, discovered mathematically by Le Verrier,
in Paris, and seen by Galle in Berlin, the 23d of September, 1846.</p>

<p>To these (now eighty) planets may be added the twenty to thirty
moons of our solar system, and a number of comets.</p>

<p>The middle position of the Earth’s orbit is not without its consequences.
The distance of the Earth from the Sun is, in round numbers,
92,000,000 of miles, nearly three times as far as that of Mercury,
the planet nearest the Sun. Jupiter, on the other hand, is
five times as far from the Sun as the Earth; Uranus about nineteen
times as far, and Neptune about thirty-three times as far.</p>

<p>The time of the Earth’s revolution around the Sun is also equally
removed from the extremes; its year is 365 days; Mercury’s being
87 days; Jupiter’s 11 of our years; Uranus 84 years; and Neptune’s
165 years.</p>

<p>The daily revolution of the Earth on its axis is also of only medium
swiftness, consuming 24 hours. This, of course, controls the
periods of waking and sleep of the entire animate creation on our
globe. Some planets revolve slower, some more rapidly than our
own; Jupiter’s revolution, for example, is accomplished in little less
than 10 hours. This extreme rapidity seems to account for the
much greater flattening at the poles of the planets than the Earth
exhibits, occasioned doubtless during the formation processes, while
those immense revolving masses were passing from their primitive
fluid state into the more rigid forms in which we know them. Of all
the planets, however, the Earth has most perfectly retained the spherical
shape; and the spherical form is in one sense a medium form; i.e.
it is removed from all extremes of angularity, and so falls in with
the analogies which I am endeavoring to establish, springing from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
the position of the Earth’s orbit <i>midway</i> between those of the inner
and outer planets. According to Plato, the beauty of form lies in
symmetry, and our Earth is the most symmetrical of planets, and,
unquestionably, the spherical shape is the one best adapted to the
display of the largest number of phenomena possible.</p>

<p>The variations from the spherical form, produced by elevations
and depressions, are only of medium magnitude in our globe compared
with many others in our system. On the smaller planet of
Venus, for example, the mountains are thought to rise to a height
of many miles, while five is the greatest altitude of ours. According
to Mädler’s conjectures, the mountains in our own moon rise to
a height of over three miles, an altitude altogether out of proportion
to the size of the moon as compared with the earth.</p>

<p>In respect to the number of its moons, too, our Earth is no extremist;
it has but one: other planets, Mercury, Venus, Mars, have
none. On the other hand, Jupiter has 4, Saturn 7, Uranus 6 at
least, and doubtless more. The general law seems to be, the farther
from the Sun the greater the number of moons; perhaps in the
wonderful providence of God, to compensate the feeble light of
those distant realms by the number of the reflecting bodies.</p>

<p>Now, summing up all that has been said, it will be seen that the
Earth is equally far removed from every extreme. This fundamental
classification, drawn from the place of its orbit in relation
to those nearer the Sun or more distant from it, gives it a character
which is felt and seen in many different things, and responds to
analogies which it is not incorrect to mark. A <i>medium</i> is seen in
all its attributes and relations: it is neither the largest nor the
smallest of planets; neither the swiftest nor the slowest; neither
the warmest nor the coldest; in nothing is it either at a minimum
nor at a maximum point. And this very medium character brings
the Earth into harmony with the system of which it forms a part;
the symmetry of the one corresponding with the symmetry of the
other, and specially fits it to become the temporary home of a race
like ours, which makes the whole surface of the globe tributary
during the short terrestrial life of man to his preparation for a
celestial state of being. Our globe is certainly the only one of our
system which could possibly be inhabited by man; and as his residence,
and as the arena for his culture, it is worthy of being studied
in all its features; no point is too trifling to be overlooked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span></p>

<p>As man looks for a center to the system which <i>evidently</i> pertains
to him, and in which our Earth plays no slight part, the Sun is
clearly the source of a large share of what makes our life desirable.
Thence we receive light, warmth, and indirectly, and yet directly
too, life and the bloom of health. Nor can men, even if ignorant
and degraded, <i>help</i> seeing the relation of the Sun to the Earth, and
linking, in their rude thoughts, the heavens with the earth; and
hence, before all higher Revelation, the worship of the Sun has been
the primitive instinct of the oldest of nations.</p>

<p>Looking at the earth as simply one among the innumerable hosts
of heaven, it, like each one of them, becomes to the imagination a
mere point of light, a “star among stars.” But, when we shift our
point of view, and leaving the cosmical or universal for the special,
for what pertains to the individual life, the mere point of light
flames up into a great, busy world, full of phenomena demanding
investigation and thought. And yet this world, so attractive in its
multiplicity of details, is almost a chaos at the first sight; a confused
and inextricable mass, so large, so high, so deep as to defy
human effort to compass or master it. Science alone, the gift and
the growth of centuries, can measure the field; science alone can
enter it and reduce the chaos to a beautiful and orderly grouping,
and make a perfect picture of the whole; it alone can dispel crude
ideas and give truer ones in their stead. To the rude dweller on
the plain, the earth seems a gigantic floor, as it did to many a tribe
in the past, and as it does to-day to thousands of wondering Arabs.
The South Sea Islander, in the Pacific, takes his island or island
group to be the whole earth; the world he considers an endless
ocean plain, from which the Sun arises, and, when the day is over,
into which it sinks. And even within the pale of civilization itself,
the ignorant Neapolitan lazzarone considers his gulf the center of
the world.</p>

<p>As men advance in their inquiries, and, ascending the sides of
mountains, look out over a larger tract, or find new lands across
the seas, they do not outgrow their first idea, the world merely expands
from the narrow homestead to a larger circle, such as the
Romans used to call their orbis terrarum. The conception of the
earth as a vast, unsupported ball, careering through the heavens,
was the possession, slowly won, of such great minds as Pythagoras
and Aristotle, and slowly found its way among the ideas which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
whole nations accepted as true. Circumnavigators must sail around
the globe and tell their story to the world before the conjectures of
science could have real weight with the popular mind in a matter
so remote from the crude speculations of the ignorant as this.
And less than one century and a half ago (in 1727) another step
was taken, and the theory was propounded by Newton, that the
Earth is a spheroid and not a perfect sphere. Later investigations
have determined that the spheroidal form is only an approximation
to perfect accuracy, and that the Earth is a polyhedron, whose
exact number of zodes has not yet been determined, and which
may prove indeterminable. Bessel has assigned, as the great task
of science for the coming century, to settle this question with perfect
exactness. But what has been said is enough to indicate that in our
knowledge, at present, certainly there is only progress, only approximation,
no absolute exhaustion of the processes of discovery.</p>

<p>And just as in ruder lands each man looks at his own island, or
village, as the center of the earth’s circle, so the ancients looked
at the earth as the pivot of the universe, the central point around
which all the heavenly hosts revolve. That was the fundamental
principle of that Ptolemaic system which was older than Ptolemy;
held in the most ancient times in Arabia, Babylon, Persia, and
India, but first luminously expanded in the proportions and with
the dignity of a system by Ptolemy. Its outlines were, in one word,
this: there are seven planets, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun,
Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn; each has its own orbit, in which it is in
a limited sense supreme, but they all revolve around the common
center, the Earth. Beyond the seven, and including them all, is
the Firmament, in which the other stars stand like golden nails in
an imperishable floor; the whole vast external Firmament is opaque
and motionless.</p>

<p>The Ptolemaic system won and held the greatest regard in the ancient
world. Mohammed established it in the Koran as a truth of
religion. The advance of science revealed the falseness of the
Ptolemaic scheme of the universe, and demonstrated the fact that
the stars of heaven are not mere torch-bearers for us, and mere
interpreters of human destinies, but are worlds like our own, our
earth being but one of numberless thousands equally worthy of the
Common Creator. The Copernican system, which was to re-create
the whole domain of science, wrought this great change. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
Sun, according to this theory, forms the central point around
which, and not around the Earth, all the planets wheel. Copernicus,
in 1543, left this imperfect and yet fruitful conception to
his successors to unfold; and in the results gained by Kepler, in
1631, by Newton and Galileo, 1727, the Copernican system was
firmly established. The vast improvements in the telescope removed
the limits of the visible universe to a place till then unrevealed,
and added inexhaustible fields to those which had been known before.
The number of the planets was enlarged. The list of determined
comets increases yearly. The number of the fixed stars has
been determined by the extreme accuracy of such observers as
Lalande, Lacaille, Bessel, Argelander, and Lamont. The great
work of mapping and cataloguing the heavens has been accomplished.
Many hundred stars, supposed to be single fixed stars,
have been ascertained to be double stars, and some have been
resolved into systems like our own. The 300-400, observed by
Struve, have grown, through the labors of Herschel, in both the
Northern and the Southern hemispheres, at the Cape of Good Hope,
and elsewhere, to over 3000, and the number is constantly increasing.
Nebulæ have been analyzed, and been shown to consist of
worlds distinct and perfect as our own. Thus there is a steady and
perceptible advance in man’s conception of the Earth, of Nature,
of what we call the World and the Universe, though each individual,
generation, and century are but dimly conscious of this progress.</p>

<h3 id="heading1"><span class="smcap">The Earth as the Dwelling-place of Man.</span></h3>

<p>The Earth draws our attention to itself, however, not as simply a
unit in the planetary system, but as the home of the human race.
The physical description of the globe includes the relations of the
Earth as a star amid the heavenly hosts, while Geography, taken
most comprehensively, regards the Earth as the dwelling-place of
Man. From a geographical point of view, the world becomes to
us the common home of our race, the theater, not of the operations
of Nature in the most unrestricted sense, but the arena for the development
of human life and history. The whole animate and inanimate
creation is tributary, looked at geographically, to the fashioning
of the destiny of Man. Without Man as the central point,
Nature would have no interest to the geographer; without the
Earth, constituted just as it is, the races of men and the course of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
human history could not claim his attention. The Earth is not
only the best known of planets, but, as the home of man, infinitely
the most interesting. The study of it is at the foundation of
history as much as of physics.</p>

<p>No man of science can fail to regard it with the deepest interest.</p>

<p>More than a hundred years ago, George Foster remarked that
European culture had ascended to that height, that it must include
an intimate knowledge of all that is peculiar in the features and
phenomena of the entire globe. How much more true is this remark
in the middle of our nineteenth century! It is no longer
European culture that demands this, but the welfare of all countries
claims of scholars this knowledge far more imperatively than a hundred
years ago. Still, it must be confessed that we are far from the
attainment of a perfect science of Geography, in its largest sense;
the science which regards the Earth as the field of human discipline;
the science of which what was formerly called Geography
is only an outlying, rudimentary part. The compass of what it
holds as its goal is too large, and its contents too varied for <i>his</i>
grasp whose existence is hemmed in by narrow bonds, and whose
life is so brief. And though there have always been detailed descriptions
of the different parts of the earth, many of them remarkable
for their accuracy, yet there has been lacking a knowledge
of the principle of organic unity which pervades the whole, and
the mutual play and interdependency of all the parts. The whole
subject of <i>relations</i> was unstudied. And it is a knowledge of the
relations of things that leads to a scientific interpretation, not the
description of detached parts. Geography was and continued to be
mere description, not the teaching of the most important relations.
Only now are we beginning to comprehend the true elements of
geographical science, only now are the first efforts made to deal
profoundly with this science, although the progress of discovery is
still going on with unabated speed, leaving far behind us all the
advances of our predecessors.</p>

<h3 id="heading2"><span class="smcap">Geography as a Science.</span></h3>

<p>The Earth, considered <i>per se</i>, is only a fragment of the Universe,
of the Kosmos, in that wide use of the word which Humboldt has
given to it in his celebrated work. The Earth is the grand floor, so
to speak, of Nature; the home, or rather the cradle, of men and of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
nations, the dwelling-place of our race. It is not merely a region
of immense spaces, a vast superficies, it is the theater where all the
forces of Nature and the laws of Nature are displayed in their
variety and independencies. Besides this, it is the field of all
human effort, and the scene of a Divine revelation. The Earth
must be studied, therefore, in a threefold relation: to the Universe,
to Nature, to History.</p>

<p>And it is not only as a mere passive agent, but active, that it assumes
this threefold relation. It is an inseparable, an integral, a
working member in the great system of things. But higher than
this, and grander than its relation to the system of <i>things</i>, is its relation
to an unseen world, to an unseen hand, even that of the
Creator. We view it not as the field of forces and laws and phenomena,
but the crowning gift of God, displaying the tokens of perfect
adaptation to our wants, full of beauty and excellence—a
revelation of Divine wisdom, in the form of a visible world. How
beautifully has the inspired David painted this in the 104th Psalm!</p>

<p>In relation to its inhabitants, crowned with the Imperial gift of
reason, the Earth is not merely the place where they may stand, the
cradle where they may sleep, the home where they may live, it is the
school where they may be trained. This is one of the first and one
of the greatest lessons that we learn from the history of the race.
The Earth finds its highest mission, not in its relation to inanimate
nature, but to the world of intelligence—the minds that dwell upon
it, the spiritual world to which it gives bodies. And as the Earth
alone of the planets is adapted to be the home of such a being as
man, so in our world of animate and inanimate things, man alone
partakes of a moral nature, incapable of being shared or even imitated
by the lower creatures. The Earth was made to be the home
of mind, soul, character. And Man was created to make this earth
tributary to his largest growth in mind, and soul, and character.
In this sense the Earth and its noble possessors are correlative.
Each individual rises to his own appointed work, runs his own
course, uses all the appliances of Nature, all the help with which
God invests him, and then ceases from his mission here; but the
Earth remains, the home of the advancing millions, helping them
all onward, and granting them new power to fulfill the noble purposes
of human life.</p>

<p>Nor can this constitution of things be the result of a happy accident.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span>
Evidently under the supreme power of a Divine mind and
will, Nature is made subservient to Man. That mutual working
and interdependence of things, which opens to our comprehension
the History of our race, cannot be ascribed to a fortuitous combination
of events. It can only be the result of Divine Providence. Had
there been no wise ruling of the blind forces of nature, no subjection
of the rough, unbridled powers of the air, and sea, and earth,
the human race would have become extinct, as so many races of
beasts have done. But there are no traces of the extinction of a
human race in our Paleontology. The constitution of the globe is
incontestably coincident with a plan to preserve and perfect Man.
There are destructive agencies, it is true, but they do not operate
on an extended scale; our earthquakes, and volcanoes, and great
storms at sea affect but a fraction of the race, they are no longer
universal in their action; while, on the contrary, the instrumentalities
which favor mankind remain in force—the earth’s changeless
garment of green, the uniform progress of generation among
subordinate creatures, the ease of acclimatization, and of transferring
seeds and germs, with undiminished fruitfulness, from one region
to another. The very agencies which, in the dawn of history,
brought death, have been changed to auxiliaries of life with us
to-day.</p>

<p>The investigation into the relations of the Earth, in this respect, and
into the organization of all the natural laws and phenomena in their
bearing on man, his life and history, must constitute a prominent
department of true geographical science. When Geography ceases
to be a lifeless aggregate of unorganized facts, and becomes the
science which deals with the earth as a true organization, a world
capable of constant development, carrying in its own bosom the
seeds of the future, to germinate and unfold, age after age, it first
attains the unity and wholeness of a science, and shows that it
grows from a living root; it becomes capable of systematic exposition,
and takes its true place in the circle of sister sciences. Philosophy
gladly grants it a share in its own domain, and permits it
to indulge in those soaring speculations, which it used to be thought
that so simple a thing as Geography might not enjoy. Yet, it must not
be denied that there has for some time been felt a need of bringing
the earth, as an organization, more into the light of scientific investigation.
The study of final causes, the tracing of infinite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span>
wisdom in the works of the Creator, the theories touching the first
issue of all things, have grown out of this necessity. Many errors
have, doubtless, drifted in during the course of these speculations;
man has undertaken to measure the Divine plan with most imperfect
data, and the illusion has been too fondly cherished of attaining
final and profound results while men were scarcely in the possession
of the elements of knowledge. It is for us, therefore, to
enter upon our inquiries with investigation rather than theory, to
test the knowledge of which tradition has put us in possession, and
to advance, as we may, to the new and the unexplored.</p>

<p>Man is the first token that we meet, that our study of the earth
must contemplate it as an organized whole, its unity consummating
in him. As every individual must, in his own career, epitomize the
history of the race, childhood, youth, manhood, and decrepitude, so
each man mirrors in his own life the locality where he lives.
Whether dwelling in the North or in the South, in the East or in
the West, whether the shepherd of the Tyrolese Highlands, or the
Hollander of the plains, every man is, in a manner, the representative
of the home that gave him birth. In the people the country
finds its reflection. The effect of the district upon the nature of its inhabitants
in size and figure, in color and temperament, in speech and
mental characteristics, is unmistakable. Hence the almost infinite
diversity in the peculiarities of culture and attainment, as well as of
tendency in different nations. Anthropology and Ethnography, the
science of man and of race, are the running commentaries of Geography
and Topography. The historian and the geographer work toward
each other,—the historian going back from the acts of men to
study the scenes which have conditioned their life, the geographer
going forward from the study of the habitat of men to that of their
deeds. The fundamental question of history is, in fact, What relation
does the country bear to the national life? What relation to
the civil structure, the state?</p>

<p>In fact, the whole constitution of Man is thoroughly connected with
the Earth on which he dwells; the roots of his being run down into
it in uncounted numbers. Man receives at birth from the earth not
only a spiritual but a physical dowry, from which he cannot free himself,
and of whose worth he becomes conscious more and more. It
is, therefore, of course one of the first of the legitimate studies to
learn the limits of the realm which Man makes his home, and to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix"></a>[xix]</span>
understand all its secrets, all its forces, so as to turn them to his
own uses. Thus alone can he compass the sublime thought of his
own freedom, the independence of his own will in the kingdom of
Nature, and learn the majesty of his own spirit; for the knowledge
of that freedom, which is the most noble of all God’s gifts to him,
is the most direct key to the attainment of that place in the present,
and that destiny in the future, which God has appointed for man.
Without a preliminary training, amid the conditions of a limited
life, can there be no step taken toward the enjoyment of the life
without limitations which is to come. Without the capacity of breaking
the higher law, there is no glory in obeying it, no freedom to be
valued, even in the world of thought. There can be no true speculation,
no philosophy of the unlimited and eternal, without inquiry
into and knowledge of the limited and conditioned. He who knows
not the earthly, cannot know the heavenly; he who knows not the
finite, cannot know the infinite. Statement and counter-statement
are the substance to the world of thought. Pythagoras investigated
matters of number and weight, before he dealt with the mysteries
of metaphysical speculation. Plato thought on the human soul,
and the practical details of legislation, before he gave himself to
the deepest things of Philosophy. Aristotle was a naturalist and
physicist, before he became a logician and metaphysician. Kant was
a mathematician and astronomer, before he dealt with the problems
of transcendental science. Schelling went from natural philosophy
to the study of the soul of things. If there have been evil results
from this, it has not been from antedating metaphysical studies by
physical, but by passing too quickly from the solid foundation-stones
to the more unstable heights of the transcendental. Without these
solid foundation-stones, philosophy falls, crushed by its own weight;
but with this preparation, we may advance to the loftiest and yet
most secure speculations.</p>

<h3 id="heading3"><span class="smcap">What Geography as a Science has yet to accomplish.</span></h3>

<p>Geography can just as little be contented with being a mere
description of the Earth, and a catalogue of its divisions, as a detailed
account of the objects in nature can take the place of a thorough
and real natural history. The very word Geography, meaning
a description of the Earth, has unfortunately been at fault, and
has misled the world: to us it merely hints at the elements, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xx"></a>[xx]</span>
factors of what is the true science of Geography. That science
aims at nothing less than to embrace the most complete and the
most cosmical view of the Earth; to sum up and organize into a
beautiful unity <i>all</i> that we know of the globe. The whole body of
facts revealed by past and present discovery must be marshaled
into harmony, before we gain the high pinnacle of Geographical
Science. The Earth, in all its parts, must be known in all its relations,
before we can speak of it as the scholars of our day ought
to speak of the world they inhabit.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Earth is to be considered in two main relations—a
relation, and an absolute relation; that is, we are to regard it in
its connection with the greater whole, of which it forms a part,
the Universe, and as a body standing alone, existing, as it were, for
itself. It is the latter view which falls within the strict province
of Geography. The very prominence of the old Greek word Γη indicates
the pre-eminence which, in this science, our own planet,
rather than others, receives. <i>Ge</i>-ography confines our attention to
the Earth, and concentrates it upon the globe, regarded <i>per se</i>,
rather than in its relations to the Universe. Taken, therefore,
strictly, as already hinted at in the foregoing remark, Geography
is the department of science that deals with the globe in all its
features, phenomena, and relations, as an independent unit, and
shows the connection of this unified whole with man and with man’s
Creator. Should we go beyond this, and discuss the relations of
the Earth to the Universe, (as is often done in our geographical
treatises, in a singularly imperfect and unfruitful manner,) we
should outrun the strict bounds of a single science, and should be
encroaching on the domain of the sister science of astronomy. This
we have no right to do. Yet, from time to time, we must borrow
the results of other departments of learning to confirm our own.
The field which we have to till has been immensely reduced in its
proportions by the publication of “Kosmos,” which great work has
almost exhausted the subject of the earth in its external relations.
The limiting of our own department may, perhaps, give more opportunity
for thorough investigation within itself.</p>

<p>The Earth, if discussed exhaustorily, must be spoken of in its
relations to Time as well as to Space. The word by which we
characterize it, in this regard, is History. The duration of the
Earth outruns all measurement. By thinking of its beginning, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxi"></a>[xxi]</span>
the only way we have of gaining a conception of Time. We cannot
conceive of the universe as antedating the creation of our earth.
By this indefinite, not to say infinite, duration of time, the Earth is
discriminated from all that it contains; it is older than any of its
parts; it antedates all its kingdoms. The nature of the whole is,
therefore, radically different from that of any of its divisions. The
Earth has had a development of its own; hence the too common
error of treating it as passive and inorganic. The history of the
Earth displays, in all the monuments of the past, that it has been
subjected in every feature, in every division of itself, to ceaseless
transformation, in order to show that, as a whole, it is capable of
that organic development on which I lay so much stress. The
natural powers which the earth includes are constantly obedient to
the mechanical laws of chemistry and physics. The animate creation,
plants, animals, man, come and go, in accordance with the laws
of their being, and as subordinate dependents on the great forces
which the earth holds locked up within her bosom. The earth, the
mother of them all, has her own special advance, her own development,
to use that overburdened German word. She has relations to
herself alone; not simply to organized forms, plants, and animals;
just as little to organic things; not simply to her own countries,
her rocks, and her crystals. These are but isolated parts; or, if
not isolated, yet bound <i>together</i> by a common tie. There is another
tie above this; it is that which binds the earth to itself alone; that
subordinates its parts to such an extent that they almost disappear.
There is, above all this thought of parts, of features, of
phenomena, the conception of the Earth as a whole, existing in
itself, and for itself, an organic thing, advancing by growth, and
becoming more and more perfect and beautiful. Without trying to
impose on you anything vague and transcendental, I wish to lead
you to view the globe as almost a living thing,—not a crystal, assuming
new grace by virtue of an external law,—but a world,
taking on grandeur and worth, by virtue of an inward necessity.
The individuality of the earth must be the watchword of re-created
Geography. To think of the Earth, as a seed sown from the hand
of God himself on the great fields of space, and filled with a germinant
power of life, which will transform it more and more, and
make it more and more worthy of its noblest inhabitant, is the first,
as it is the last, idea which we must take and keep in these inquiries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxii"></a>[xxii]</span></p>

<p>Formerly, Geography was regarded as a mere auxiliary of History,
Politics, Military Science, Natural History, the Industrial
Arts, and Commerce. And in truth it does reach out and teach
all these departments of knowledge and action; but only in the
most recent times has it assumed the place of an independent branch
of study. Only through the widening of the whole circle of sciences
has room been made for this.</p>

<p>Geography used, for the sake of commerce, to be divided into three
divisions: mathematical, physical, and political. This was at the
time when it was thought that the whole frame-work of the sciences
was a disjointed and sundered thing; before that minor principle of
unity which binds them all together was recognized as one of the
noblest conceptions that the mind can cherish. In the first two of
these arbitrary divisions into which Geography was severed, the relations
of astronomy, mathematics, and physics were studied, and
their applications to the confused phenomena of the globe investigated.
Yet the most important thing of all escaped notice; students
overlooked their chief task, the tracing of causation and
interdependence in the phenomena, and the relation of every one
to the country which supplies its conditions of being. It was not
suspected that each phenomenon was one link of a great chain of
phenomena, the whole revealing a comprehensive law. Men discussed
porphyritic formations, basaltic columns, hot springs, and a
thousand features which dot the earth, and a thousand kinds of
rock which rift the surface of the globe, and treated them singly
as if each was a spore and the whole combination only a sporadic
group. They did not discover that in the one feature was to be
found the reason of the existence of its neighbor; that all the
layers of stone owe their singularities of structure to one another
rather than to themselves; that each one stands in the closest connection
with the upheaval of the loftiest mountains, with the formation
of great volcanic islands, and, in truth, with the building up of
entire continents. And, in like manner, plants were discussed as
if they were obedient to no law of grouping, as if they were scattered
broadcast over the earth, having no relation to zones of vegetation,
to isothermal and isochimenal lines; as if, in fact, there was
no suspicion of any principle underlying the very existence of the
whole vegetable kingdom. And so, too, with such phenomena as
the Aurora Borealis; they were treated as isolated features, rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiii"></a>[xxiii]</span>
than in their relations to the globe; the connection was not seen
between the maritime discoveries of voyagers and the great system
of oceanic currents, on which voyagers are so dependent; in fact,
the whole influence of the world of matter on the world of mind
was unexplored.</p>

<p>And in order to study what was called Political Geography, a vast
mass of materials was converted into a stiff, ritualistic frame-work,
in the effort to impose some system and imaginal completeness on
it, and not in order to grasp facts and truths in their mutual relations
and inward life; they were merely arranged for convenient
reference and for available use in the departments of military science,
politics, statistics, and history; a method which is plainly our
inheritance from the Middle Ages, and which bears the marks of
those days. Thus from this arbitrary arrangement, made without
reference to any indwelling necessity, sprang the three groups with
which we are familiar: Chronography and Topography forming
the first, Ethnography and Anthropology the second, and Statistics
and History the third, or Political Geography.</p>

<p>From these three groups our ordinary text-books compile their
usual aggregate of facts, and each becomes after its own pattern a
motley in miniature. They contain variable quantities of this triple
mass of materials, and follow no law but the demands of the time
when they see the light; they favor, like our light literature, the
whim of the hour, and are political, military, or commercial, as the
public may demand. A systematic exposition of geography is very
seldom to be found in them. A harmony of parts, a true harmony,
is very rarely attained in their pages. They are at the foundation
only arbitrary and unmethodical collections of all facts which are
ascertained to exist throughout the earth. They are arranged according
to countries, or great natural divisions; but the relation
of one great natural division to another, the mutual and immense
influence of one country on another, is never mentioned. The description
of Europe follows in them to-day the same order in which
Strabo set the pattern. The facts are arranged as the pieces of a
counterpane, as if every one existed in itself and for itself, and
had no connections with others. The setting out of these facts follows
the rubrical method of grouping, according to boundary, soil,
mountains, rivers, products, and cities. The beginning is usually
made with <i>boundaries</i> which are generally most unstable and uncertain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiv"></a>[xxiv]</span>
instead of being made with some rudimental fact around which
all others arrange themselves as a center.</p>

<p>If we compare these geographical treatises with those made in
the interest of any other great department, we shall speedily discover
that they indicate knowledge rather than science; they form
a mere aggregation and index of rich materials, a lexicon rather
than a true text-book. And therefore ensues, despite the undenied
interest of the subject and its high claims, the mechanical and unfruitful
method only too common—the crowding of the memory
without judgment, without thought; thence comes it that Geography
has taken so low a place among our school studies, worthy
only of the youngest of the pupils, and presenting little stimulus
even to them.</p>

<p>It will be my effort, in the course of these lectures, to exhibit the
subject of relations rather than to detain you with descriptions; in
one word, to generalize rather than to add new details. In the
lack of a thoroughly excellent text-book of geography, I shall
presuppose an acquaintance on your part with the materials, so to
speak, of which the science is to be constructed.</p>

<p>It has been a customary method to treat geography in connection
with epochs of time; dealing with it as it was in the past and as
it is in the present. We hear of Ancient Geography, the Geography
of the Middle Ages, and Modern Geography. In this course of
lectures, it will be treated not as the property of one age or another,
but rather as a growth of all time, from Herodotus down to our day.
It is only in this way that we can ascertain what is permanent and
what is ephemeral; only in this way can we subject geography to
that comparative method which has given such an impetus to the
advancement of the sister sciences of Natural History; only in this
way can we see how the present is the birthright of the past.
Archæology, ethnography, and civil science are all gainers by this
method of treatment; in one word, the whole domain of cotemporaneous
study. The less positive knowledge we possess of the formative
processes of science, the more crude our hypotheses, the more
flagrant our errors. This is constantly verified under our eyes;
the errors of the past are the wisdom of the present, and the gradual
upheavals of our knowledge become indices, not less of outgrown
untruths than of truths yet to be revealed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxv"></a>[xxv]</span></p>

<h3 id="heading4"><span class="smcap">Sources of Geographical Science.</span></h3>

<p>The sources of geography, as of history, are twofold—established
memorials and continued investigations. The study of it has
this great advantage at the outset, that the surface of the earth is
a standing monument of the past. We are obliged to search where
all lies open; where investigation must be crowned with success.
No manuscripts in this great library have perished; they all exist as
legible, as accessible as ever. Moreover, personal investigation
must be made by every student in order to understand the results
of the investigations of others. Wherever our home is, there lie all
the materials which we need for the study of the entire globe.
Humboldt hints at this when he says in his Kosmos: “Every little
nook and shaded corner is but a reflection of the whole of Nature.”
The roaring mountain brook is the type of the thundering cataract;
the geological formations of a single little island, suggest the broken
coast lines of a continent; the study of the boulders which are so
thickly scattered in token of a great primeval deluge from the north,
reveals the structure of whole mountain chains. The digging of
every well may contribute to our knowledge of the earth’s crust;
the excavations made in the building of railroads may, without the
loss of time, labor, and expense, be a ceaseless source of instruction.
In the structure of a spear of grass, of a rush, of a single
monocotyledon, may be studied in miniature the palm-tree, prince
of the tropics; in the mosses and lichens on our walls, the
stunted growths of mountain tops may be investigated. A small
range of hills may be taken as the type of the loftiest Cordillera.
The eye may be easily trained to see all the greater in the less.
The study of our own district is the true key to the understanding of
the forms and the phenomena of foreign lands. Whoever has wandered
through the valleys and woods, and over the hills and mountains
of his own State, will be the one capable of following a Herodotus
in his wanderings over the globe. He, and he alone, will
be able, with true appreciation, to accompany travelers through all
foreign lands. The very first step in a knowledge of geography is
to know thoroughly the district where we live.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the text-books which we now possess do not discuss,
with any approach to exhaustiveness, the districts where their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvi"></a>[xxvi]</span>
readers live; and hence they cannot give any true inductive generalization
of the large and the remote. In ancient times, the
study of geography began with the world of nature, not with the
world of books. Herodotus, being 444 years B. C., became, by
virtue of his investigations on his wanderings, the first critical
geographer of the Greeks. Polybius traveled through the Alps
and Pyrenees, Gaul and Spain, to be able to write the history of
Hannibal’s campaigns. He explored the Black Sea and Egypt, in
quest of facts. He is the father of all military geography; the
greatest strategists have busied themselves with writing commentaries
on Polybius. Strabo, the most industrious geographer of his
age, did not write till he had traveled from the Caucasus to the
Rhone, and from the Alps to Ethiopia.</p>

<p>Philip Cluver, of Dantzig, who died in 1623, the true founder of
classical geography, collected, by personal investigations, the materials
of his great work on Germany, Italy, and ancient Sicily, all
of which countries he traversed thoroughly, the classic authors in
his hand.</p>

<p>Alexander von Humboldt has become, by his thorough studies
of nature in Europe, Asia, and America, the founder of Comparative
Geography. He was thoroughly acquainted with every geographical
form in the neighborhood of his home, before he traveled
into foreign lands. These examples show that personal investigation
is one of the most reliable of all sources of geographical
knowledge.</p>

<p>The second class of these sources is the accounts given in the published
memoirs of travelers. In more primitive days than these,
when very little was known regarding the earth, personal examination
was easily completed, with a good degree of fullness, by almost
any tourist. With the advance of knowledge, the narratives of
travelers have increased, and the sum total of facts observed has
become unwieldy; and, where facts have been wanting, the imagination
has amply supplied their place. Of course, a single life soon
became too short for the personal examination of every quarter of
the globe; the narratives of those who had thoroughly explored
any one were accepted as authoritative, and these accounts soon
became the most generally available of all the sources of geographical
knowledge. Yet, with this limitation, that now their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvii"></a>[xxvii]</span>
abundance and their exactness tend to repress and almost to destroy
any personal inquiry whatever. Nothing can take the place
of some exploration and investigation on the part of the student
of geography.</p>

<p>To the accounts of scientific travelers, may be added those maps
and globes which indicate the contour and the vertical elevations
and depressions of the earth or its divisions. The demand for perfect
accuracy in these is now very great. The map must be a portrait,
not a caricature. In its way, the map has a certain dictatorial
authority; it is so decisive in its very character, that errors in it are
far more dangerous than in the letter-press of books. The English
excel in the beauty of their maps: there are none in the world engraved
with the rare excellence of theirs; but their care to secure
accuracy is not commensurate. The French and the Germans vie
for the honor of perfectly transcribing nature.</p>

<h3 id="heading5"><span class="smcap">The Sciences illustrative of Geography.</span></h3>

<p>The sciences which are called in to illustrate the thorough study
of geography have largely increased in number within the past few
years. They are, for the most part, the same which illustrate history;
to which may be added mathematics and natural history. It
is a very great mistake to suppose that all that bears upon geography
can be crowded within the covers of a single book. It is commonly
supposed that geography is a matter of memory. Even in its
elementary forms, it is capable of a constructive treatment. Many
a teacher, who has not paid special attention to this department,
dreams that he can qualify himself by running through a single
text-book. No philologist would dream that, with a grammar and
dictionary, he could grasp any constructive theory of language.
There must first be the study, comparatively, of the great classes.
And in geography, the personal study of the earth, with critical
closeness, and in the comparative method, is the true way.</p>

<p>Another very common error is, that geography must subsidize
what is most striking in other sciences, and thereby gain its charms
and attain its uses. Thus geography becomes everything—history,
statistics, statecraft, physics, a catalogue of all the possessions of
natural history, in all its kingdoms. It takes on all colors, and
meanwhile loses its own. It merges all its individuality in other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxviii"></a>[xxviii]</span>
provinces. In no way can it escape this disintegrating force, unless
by holding fast to some central principle of being; and that is the
relation of all the phenomena and forms of nature to the human
race. It cannot exist, if it is to be merely an aggregate of all
science, a mosaic of all colors. It is to use the whole circle of
sciences to illustrate its own individuality, not to exhibit their
peculiarities. It must make them all give a portion, not the whole,
and yet must keep itself single and clear.</p>

<p>For the comprehension of mathematical geography, a knowledge
of the elements of mathematics and astronomy is indispensable.
For determining localities, and for using many needed instruments,
there must be some skill in practical astronomy; for measuring distances,
for projecting maps and charts, and locating geographical
districts upon them, there must be some familiarity with trigonometry
and the higher mathematics. No one can thoroughly study
geography in foreign lands, and leave all astronomical instruments
behind.</p>

<p>Political geography demands an acquaintance with history, and
the same helps which the study of history requires. The civil
status of no country can be determined without this. Büsching’s
“Europe” was a master-piece of its time. But it was impossible
for even that book to compress within its covers the whole history
of that continent in its relation to the geography of Europe.</p>

<p>The study of Man is, of course, in most intimate alliance with
geography. It is only since the opening of this century that ethnography
has become a prominent and clearly defined province of
science, and enabled to become a great tributary of geography; in
fact, the greatest tributary. Other departments are also drawn
upon; there can be no close study of the soil, the structure of mountains
and plains, without mineralogy and geology. Meteorology,
too, the science which discusses the climatic conditions of countries
and the effects of climate upon the organization of plants, animals,
and man, is of no mean value in illustrating geography. Nor can
one be a great geographer who does not understand the flora of the
world. Not that he needs to be familiar with the myriads of plants,
but the laws of growth and the characteristics of localization must
be known. The geographer does not need to repeat in detail where
the cereals and the palm-tree thrive. The general conditions which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxix"></a>[xxix]</span>
control the growth of plants are all that he has to concern himself
with. The main auxiliary for this is furnished in the botanical
garden, where the eye sees the products of all localities, arranged,
according to their grouping, in the countries where they are indigenous.
Botany and zoology and mineralogy are among the sciences
most valuable in throwing light upon geography; they display best
what wealth each country holds in store for the uses of man; for
they are closely connected with the development of industry, the
arts, and trade.</p>

<p>This brings us to the last province, commerce, the science of interchange.
The study of minerals, of the distribution of plants
and animals, is of little advantage, aside from commerce and its
uses to man. It is the interchange of the products of one region
for those of another which has had, on the whole, the greatest influence
on the human race. Think, for an instant, of the transfer
of the potato from America to Europe, of maize to Asia; of the far
more ancient introduction of wheat and rice from Asia into Europe;
and not these alone, but almost all the fruits. Think of the carrying
from Asia to America, and, in fact, to all tropical lands, such products
as sugar, coffee, and cotton. Think, too, of the results of the search
for gold, ivory, and slaves in the interior of Africa, and of gold in
California and Australia, opening such immense districts to settlements.
The search after platina has disclosed the most guarded
recesses of the Cordilleras and the Ural chain; while the need of
copper first gave us our complete knowledge of the great system
of American lakes. Without the expeditions to secure the whale,
the walrus, and the seal, as well as the fur-bearing animals, the
polar world would be still untraversed. The discovery of coal on a
hundred shores otherwise unknown, led to the settlement of man in
colonies from India and China southward to the Antarctic Continent,
and northward to Nova Zembla, Spitzbergen, and Greenland.</p>

<p>And not the continents only, seas and oceans have been thoroughly
studied, in order to secure a safe pathway for man to the regions
which contain his spoils. In the furtherance of this, the highest
praise must be awarded to the British government. Through its
enterprise and liberality, almost every island group has been examined,
a thorough study of marine currents undertaken, careful
soundings made in all waters, and a most extensive chartography<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxx"></a>[xxx]</span>
accomplished. The charts published by the English admiralty already
are counted by thousands.</p>

<p>Yet the French have not been backward in like investigations.
Understanding the value of commerce, their Dépôt de la Marine has
not been inactive. Scandinavia has also done her part. The
United States has accomplished one of the most thorough coast
surveys ever undertaken by any nation; its difficulties are only to
be measured by its extent. In fact, the whole civilised world has
sent its messengers to the ends of the earth, and have united in
this grand crusade of our age, the enriching of all men by a liberal
system of interchange of the commodities of all climes.</p>

<h1>COMPARATIVE GEOGRAPHY.</h1>

<span class="smaller">THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH CONSIDERED IN ITS MOST
GENERAL RELATIONS.</span></h2>

</div>

<h3 id="heading6">The Spheroidal Form of the Earth.</h3>

<p>The measurements of, and investigations into the figure
of the earth, have led, as already stated in the introduction,
to no absolutely certain conclusion; yet they have
made it certain that the earth is, in a general sense, a
spheroid. There are many discrepancies, as were then
stated, from the perfectly spheroidal shape; still it is in this
sense a spheroid, that the polar diameter is not of the same
length with the equatorial diameter.</p>

<p>The globular form of the earth, using that word in a
loose sense, has been established with certainty since
Newton’s time. The experience of circumnavigators, the
uniform shield-shape of the shadow of the earth during
eclipses of the moon, are witnesses to this. The gradual
emerging and disappearance of objects, such as ships on
the sea, in coming and going, caravans on the desert, of
mountains as they are approached, establish the fact.
These proofs are so well known that we but touch on them
and pass to what is not so obvious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>As soon as the fact was established that the earth was
a subordinate member of a system, it was brought into
analogy with other planets, and their uniformly spherical
shape was considered another valid reason for attributing
the same to our globe. The discovery of the rotation of
the earth on its axis was still another argument in the same
direction. Mathematical measurements and observations
of the pendulum, taken at different stations, have confirmed
the same result.</p>

<p>To measure a spherical body, it is only necessary to take
the length of a degree in one of its great circles, and to
multiply its length by 360, the number of degrees. The
method of measuring a degree on the earth’s surface is by
taking two stars, just one degree apart, dropping, by astronomical
and mathematical means, vertical lines upon
the earth from them and measuring the distances apart of
the points where those lines impinge upon the globe. This
can be done with perfect accuracy. Such investigations
show that the degrees are not all of equal length, as they
would be were the earth a perfect sphere. Nearer the
poles they are longer, nearer the equator they are shorter.
The curvature of the earth is therefore greater as you approach
the equatorial line, and less as you recede from it.
In general terms, then, the earth is an oblate spheroid, as
it would be a prolate spheroid were the lengths of its
diameters reversed. By the most accurate measurements,
those of the astronomer Bessel, if the equatorial diameter
were divided into 289 equal parts, the polar diameter would
measure 288 of them, being ¹⁄₂₈₉ shorter.</p>

<p>To this must be added what was said in the introduction,
that the surprising accuracy of modern instruments
and modern investigations, applied to meridian circles and
parallels of latitude, have determined the fact that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
spheroid is not a perfect one, (just as so often in nature
the ideal is rather striven after than attained,) but an irregular
polyhedron of an indeterminate number of sides.
Still for all practical purposes, these minute inquiries have
no value, and it is enough to treat of the earth as a perfect
globe, so far, at least, as map-drawing is concerned.
The deviation from a perfectly spherical shape is so inconsiderable
that in an artificial globe of eighteen inches
diameter it would hardly amount to the thickness of a
sheet of paper; still, small as this is represented on a
miniature scale, it has, doubtless, great importance on the
great scale of a world like this, both in affecting somewhat
the perturbation of other heavenly bodies which depend
on the earth, as well as the perturbations in the earth’s
own motion. Besides this, which is really not a small
point in consideration of the possible results which the
minutest perturbation of one little planet may have on the
universe, there is one other, more appreciable in its results,
the probable influence of this spheroidal, or rather
polyhedrons form, in producing the unequal division of land
and water upon the surface of the earth. The apparent
want of any principle or reason for this inequality has
long perplexed geographers, and there seems to be no
more satisfactory solution than the one to which I have
just alluded. In the course of future investigations into
the yet undetermined exact mathematical form of the
earth, the law which controls the division into land and
water will be more thoroughly understood. Unquestionably
the position of the great oceans depends upon their
distance from the center of the globe, and although the
present proportion of land and water seems fortuitous,
undoubtedly it has a uniformly acting, and a thoroughly
appreciable law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<h3 id="heading7">The Threefold Covering of the Earth.</h3>

<p>What may in the largest and most general sense be
called the superficies of the earth, is threefold in character,
and yet one in function; consisting of a highly elastic
body, the atmosphere, water, and the solid ground. These
three forms are variously proportioned; the more elastic
is universal, the fluid form is more restricted, and the solid
one prevails still less. The more dense the body, the nearer
it is found to the center of the earth. The lightest of all
floats over the entire periphery of the globe like a graceful
mantle of cloud. Man, and in fact all organisms,
live by contact with all three of these forms. The investigation
of the elements, and phenomena of the air, <i>regarded
in themselves</i>, is the province of meteorology.
The mercury-column is the true language of the atmosphere,
and tells us in distinct tones of all the changes
there. Mineralogy and geology make us acquainted with
all the qualities and all the elements of the soil, not in their
relation to man, but regarded in themselves. Geography
deals with the conflict of all these bodies, their relations to
each other, their mutual action and reaction. Meteorology
gives occasion for the study of climate, and for the observation
of the phenomena of the lower strata of the atmosphere,—the
fall of rain and snow, for example. Geology
and mineralogy give rise to the study of plains and mountain
formations, as well as of volcanic phenomena, affecting
the surface of the earth as they do in earthquakes,
upheavals of whole districts, and the opening of hot springs.
Thus, geography has it own province clearly defined, and
uses all this and studies it in relation to the organic world,
and to man foremost of all.</p>

<p>The most highly elastic covering of the earth is unbroken,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
the other two are sundered, and each only occupies
a part of the surface. Formerly, in most ancient
times, the water seems to have covered the entire earth.
The study of this is, however, within the domain of geology.
We have to do only with the historic period which
followed. We have to look at the earth in its present relations,
and as the home of man. Now, the portions covered
with water are, by far, the largest part of the surface;
a little less than three-fourths are water, a little more
than one-fourth land. The whole water-mass is composed
largely of the oceans, which, in one sense, constitute a
continent of their own: in looking at them as we do now,
we are not to regard them as ceasing at the outlines of the
great land-masses, but as penetrating these as far as to the
springs which feed the rivers; for the world of waters,
embracing springs, brooks, rivers, lakes, seas, and oceans,
is one, and but one.</p>

<p>The water is, in some respects, a form between the other
two; its peculiarities, weight, density, freedom of movement,
and changeableness of form, are a mean between
the opposing extremes of air and the ground. Water can
pass to a more fluid or a more solid state; it can become
vapor or ice. The measurement of the depth of the world
of waters has lately been so clearly connected with the
needs of civilization, that geographers have made many
exceedingly accurate investigations. Formerly, this was
much neglected; up to Captain Cook’s time 1500 feet was
the greatest depth ascertained; in the course of the Arctic
discoveries 7000 feet limited the plummet’s descent; Captain
Ross sounded, near St. Helena, to a depth of 30,000
feet; and Captain Denhorn, in the South Atlantic, reached
a point 46,000 feet from the surface—about twice the
height of the loftiest mountains. And not single points<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
alone, but entire ocean districts have been traversed; the
temperature of these great depths has been studied, the
currents, the density, in fact all the features which must
be known preliminarily to the laying of great lines of submarine
telegraphs, such, for example, as that proposed
between North America and Europe.</p>

<p>The atmosphere, too, is by no means thoroughly known
to us. It rises to a height between 85 and 95 miles from
the earth, of which man has explored in balloons only
about five miles, or the height of the loftiest mountains.
At loftier heights than we can live, the bright light of mid-day
even fades into a dim kind of twilight, and meteoric
masses of iron are seen in full glow, there being oxygen
enough even there to support their combustion, and very
little resistance to overcome from the density of the atmosphere.
Astronomers, Benzenberg in particular, have
calculated the distance of the meteors to range from 23
to 100 miles from the earth, and have studied them<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in
respect to the time when they were visible, their locality,
and their direction. The limits of the atmosphere must
be at that point where the expansive power of air and the
attractive influence of the globe neutralize each other.
The form of the atmospheric body is therefore, like the
earth, spheroidal, but far more oblate than the earth, in
consequence of its much greater fluidity. At the poles,
the distance is therefore much less from the surface of the
earth to the confines of the atmosphere than at the equator.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
The effect of this upon the refraction of light must
be very great.</p>

<p>The investigation of the interior of the earth is more
difficult to us than that of the atmosphere even. We cannot
say that we <i>know</i> thoroughly more than we can learn
by penetrating ¹⁄₆₀₀₀ part of the distance to the center of
the globe. Deeper than that our lowest shafts have not
sunk. The coal mines of England penetrate perhaps the
farthest below the sea level; for the deep mines in Germany,
in the Hartz district, for instance, have their entrance
hundreds of feet above it. One coal mine near
Durham, England, descends to a depth of about 1584 feet,
and reaches a point where the thermometer is 79° Fahrenheit.
The deep coal mines of England have, however,
one rival, in a shaft at Liege, which is sunk 1800 feet.</p>

<p>The modern Artesian well has gone to still greater
depths, in the effort to procure brine for the manufacture
of salt, or fresh water for the use of cities. At Rehme,
in Porta Westphalica, a point 2160 feet from the surface
has been reached, and water brought up at a temperature
of 90° Fahrenheit, containing four per cent. of salt. By
an ingenious application of mechanics to the process of
well boring, doubtless a depth of 5000 feet could be attained.
At Mondorf, in Luxemburg, a bore has been
made through sandstone and the mineral formations lying
beneath it, for a distance of 2700 feet, and water reached
at 82° Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>The great upheavals caused by earthquakes and volcanoes
disclose still vaster depths. In the eruptions of the
latter, immense masses of the inner contents of the earth
are thrown out, sometimes enough to form a not insignificant
mountain, and to desolate large regions with their
debris. As a general thing, the original mineral forms are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
lost and indistinguishable in the molten mass. Yet not
seldom perfect specimens are hurled out, imbedded in
lava and cinders; not always minute fragments, sometimes
huge blocks, testifying not with any degree of completeness,
yet clearly, to a certain extent, of the composition
of the region bordering on the great inner sea of
molten matter. Yet most of our knowledge upon this
subject is hypothetical, and what we know only indicates
painfully the great extent of that of which we are entirely
ignorant.</p>

<p>The uniform increase of temperature, as we descend into
the earth, at the rate of about 24° Fahrenheit for every 100
feet, the heat of some mineral springs, leads to the conclusion
that, could we advance to a place about twenty-three
miles from the surface, we should attain the limits where
all becomes a molten mass. The cold surface, on which
we walk in such security, seems, by all analogies, to envelop
a liquid caldron which has been seething from the
morning of the world. This internal mass is, of course, the
source of all volcanic eruptions, and of all the phenomena
to which I have alluded above. A distinguished geologist
has well said that “light and heat are the two extremes
of being: the farther man goes away from the earth’s surface,
he encounters light; the farther he recedes inwardly
from its surface, he encounters heat.” It is true we are not
absolutely certain that the rate of increase is uniform, at the
rate of one degree Fahrenheit for every 45 feet; but if it
is, we should reach the boiling point of water at less than
10,000 feet from the surface, and the melting point of iron
(22° Fahrenheit) a little over 120,000 feet. The relation
of this thickness to the entire diameter of the earth is
about as 1 to 344, about the ratio of the thickness of an
egg-shell to the egg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<h3 id="heading8">The Superficial Dimensions of the Land and Water on
the Globe.</h3>

<p>The equatorial diameter of the earth, 7925·6 miles, multiplied
into the circumference, 24898·8, equals 197,339,590,
the number of square miles on the earth’s surface, reckoning
as if of a true sphere. The deduction to be made,
in consequence of its spheroidal shape, has not yet been
estimated with any approach to nicety. The sum indicated
above is exact enough to satisfy geographical purposes;
enough to lead to the laws of relative rather than
to a minute individualization. The proportion even of
land to water has not been determined, except with approximate
accuracy. It has been commonly stated that
two-thirds are water and one-third land; others have
computed three-fifths to be water and two-fifths land.
The most accurate measurements, those instituted by
Humboldt, have left it in this statement, that if the whole
be taken as one, the sea occupies ·734, the land ·265, or,
reduced and simplified in almost unchanged form, a little
more than three-quarters water, a little less than one-quarter
land. Of course it is impossible, as yet, to attain
to accuracy in these estimates, as our knowledge is
imperfect regarding the polar regions; there are about
17,000,000 square miles unexplored.</p>

<p>The ascertaining of superficial areas with exactness is
one of the most costly operations undertaken in the interest
of science. The first mathematical survey of France,
one hundred and fifty years ago, undertaken by Cassini,
cost four millions; the second sixteen millions; a third, still
more costly, has been made within the present century.
Still, it must be said that few countries have expended
money in this direction with as much prodigality as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
France. In Turkey, for instance, so little accuracy has
been attained, that the survey of that country, undertaken
by Beauchamp early in this century, resulted in establishing
the Sultan in possession of 17,000 square miles
which he had supposed were covered by the Black Sea.
The recent surveys of Prussia have rectified similar mistakes,
and, in the constantly increasing accuracy, have
given hundreds of square miles to the Crown. Many
countries, and in truth the most, have never been subjected
to a strict mensuration. The jagged coast lines
of islands and continents have been so great a barrier, that
we have to speak with great uncertainty of the superficial
contents which they inclose. The statements of these
make no pretense, therefore, to accuracy. We must be
content, at present, with the rudest approximation. This
accounts for the discrepancy in our geographical compendia;
no two of them agree, unless one servilely copies
the other. The statistics relating to the superficial contents
of continents, and of separate countries, must be
taken with a great deal of allowance. The evil cannot
be remedied at present; it will be, doubtless, at some
future day. The discrepancies which it occasions will be
seen, from the fact that the area of Europe has been computed
to be between 3,254,800 and 3,870,500 square miles;
that of Asia between 16,180,000 and 16,831,600; that
of Africa between 11,257,200 and 11,513,600; that of
America between 12,140,400 and 15,963,600; that of
Australia between 2,756,000 and 3,201,200 square miles.</p>

<p>According to this, Asia is five times as large as Europe,
and almost six times as large as the continent of Australia.
Africa is three times as large as Europe. America is four
times as large as Europe, and is as large as Africa and
Australia combined. Europe would make about one-third<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
of Africa, one-quarter of America, one-fifth of Asia. Our
present knowledge does not allow us to speak more definitely
nor exactly.</p>

<h3 id="heading9">Contrast of the Land and Water Hemispheres.</h3>

<p>Whether we divide the globe into northern and southern
or eastern and western hemispheres, their relative amounts
of land and water will be different The northern hemisphere
contains (speaking approximatively as above) 38,541,600
square miles of land, and 59,619,700 of water; the
southern, 12,847,200 of land, and 85,526,100 of water.
The eastern hemisphere contains 36,760,800 square miles
of land, and 61,401,000 of water; the western, 14,628,000
of land, and 83,533,300 of water.</p>

<p>Besides the division quantitatively, the division in respect
to symmetry of shape is entirely irregular. Symmetry,
as we usually use the word, consists in the arrangement
of parts at equal distances, or two sides at least, from
some central point or line. Mineral crystals are regarded
in relation to the point where crystallization began; plants
are viewed in relation to the stem-axis; animals in relation
to the symmetry of the entire structure. A similar
law of symmetry is entirely wanting to the globe; its
arrangement is altogether unlike this; it is not nearly so
perceptible at first glance, yet it is far more profound in
design and comprehensive in its relations.</p>

<p>The land is broken up into masses, varying in size, and
called, arbitrarily, continents and islands. Strictly speaking,
there are but two continents, the old world forming
one, the new world the other. Australia may be called
the smallest continent or the largest island; it is the connecting
link between the forms, and shows at a glance the
arbitrary distinction. We might easily go further and call<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
New Guinea, Borneo, Sumatra, Great Britain, and Java,
continents, and, on the other hand, we might designate the
old and the new world as islands. There is nothing absolute
here but the usage of speech.</p>

<p>The continents and islands lie mainly in the northern
hemisphere, (38,341,600 square miles,) scarcely a third
part of their superficies (12,847,200 square miles) being in
the southern.</p>

<p>The continents are so situated also that the eastern contains
by far the largest body of land, (36,760,800 square
miles,) the western being only about one-third as large,
(13,628,000 square miles.) America, the western, it will
be seen, has no first-class island lying near it; it stands
isolated.</p>

<p>It is seen by this that the greatest mass of land lies in
the northern hemisphere, dividing the earth in one way,
and in the eastern dividing it in another; the smallest
mass in the southern and the western. In the northeast
the watery realm is the most contracted, in the southwest
the least. We are thus enabled to speak of the land side
of the globe, the land hemisphere, and a water side, the
water hemisphere.</p>

<p>The central point of the water hemisphere is at the island
of New Zealand. Toward this the points of all the continents
are directed. The center of the land hemisphere is
in the northwest of Europe, at a point near southeast of
England, the northeast of France, and the coast of Holland.
The dwellers around the North Sea are the antipodes
of the New Zealanders. Great Britain is the country
which, as a whole, is the middle point of the continental
world. In the oceanic world, the islands lie like
scattered dots, insignificant in respect to area, in comparison
with the waste of waters which surrounds them, while,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
on the other hand, the land hemisphere is so solidly compacted,
that even the Arctic Ocean becomes merely a broad
channel.</p>

<p>Thus arises the first great contrast which we have to
study: the first, and next to the great primary distinction
between the North and South, the most important. The
division into land and water, aside from commerce, must
exercise the strongest influence on the distribution of
heat and cold, affecting the temperature of all the zones.
This influence has been fully noticed and brought before
the world by Alexander von Humboldt. It is sufficient to
refer to it now as a well-determined fact in physical
geography.</p>

<p>The heat equator is a little farther north than the mathematical
equator, because the land hemisphere has a greater
heat capacity (if we may use an awkward but apt word)
than the water hemisphere. All other isothermal lines
are modified in their greater or less coincidence with the
parallels of latitude as they advance from the heat equator
toward the maximum of the land hemisphere, or, in general
terms, as they go northward. In the western hemisphere
the isothermal lines follow much more exactly
the parallels of latitude than in the eastern, which is pre-eminently
the land hemisphere. In America the proximity
of immense masses of water causes a perceptible reduction
of the heat from that of the eastern where the land form
prevails. And the heat diminishes more as we advance
toward the South Pole, than toward the North, in consequence
of the greater deficiency of land in the southern
hemisphere; while in Lapland, Greenland, and in Siberia,
even within the polar circle itself, men find sustenance
and trees live, in the same latitude, at the South Pole, no
vegetable life, worth mentioning, is found. The frigid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
zone and the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
are not coincident with those of the northern. The icebergs
which are formed at the South Pole are carried
much nearer to the equator than those found at the North
Pole.</p>

<p>An important phenomenon, first pointed out by A. von
Humboldt and Dove, is closely connected with what has
just been said. The Atlantic shores of the old world are
warmer than those in the same latitude of the new world.
Norway, England, and France are warmer than Labrador
and Canada; Spain, Portugal, and Morocco are warmer
than Florida; Congo and Benguela are warmer than Brazil,
although the countries brought in contrast all lie on the
same parallel.</p>

<p>A similar analogy is drawn from the west shore of
America: Northern California is warmer than Japan and
Corea, which are in the same latitude. It is true, other
factors are at work to produce this, such as winds, marine
currents, elevations of land, etc., of which more will be
said hereafter.</p>

<p>Both of the two great land divisions of the earth, it
will thus be seen, have their peculiarities. But there is a
great equalizer of their diversities, found in a great coast-belt,
of which I must briefly speak. It passes from the
Cape of Good Hope northeasterly at an angle of 45°,
passing through the Mozambique channel, thence skirting
the entire southeastern and eastern coast of Asia, taking
in China, Corea, Japan, and South Kamtckatka; thence it
turns southward, following the whole western shore of
America to Cape Horn. This belt is broken at only two
points—a brief break at the north, at Behring’s Straits,
and a large one between Cape Horn and the Cape of Good
Hope; in other words, at the points nearest to the North<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
and the South Poles respectively. This coast belt has a
relation to the habitable world similar to that held by the
temperate zone as a mediator between the torrid and the
frigid. It partakes of the character of the sea and the
land, and shows the advantages of both. It does not run
parallel with the lines of latitude, but crosses them diagonally,
in the same direction with the ecliptic, though at a
more acute angle. This belt moderates all extremes.
Coincident with it are the paths of the sea and land winds,
the course of the monsoons, the most fertile shores of the
whole globe. It divides the surface of the globe into
three great divisions, the two great bodies of water, and
the great, and, comparatively speaking, unbroken (for the
break at Behring’s Straits is of little importance) land-mass.
On the great coast line referred to above is the
center of the great natural acclivities of the globe. It is
the most varied, the most stimulating, and the most productive
in all departments of the vegetable and animal
kingdoms. The Atlantic coast belt, which also has great
influence on the eastern districts of the new world and
the western districts of the old, crosses the great coast
belt at almost right angles at the place of its great sundering
between Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>If the contrast between the sea and the land has the
effect indicated above on the general development of organic
life, it must of course have great effect also on the
life and character of man. Man eminently depends upon
the conditions amid which his lot is cast. The inhabitant
of one of the Pacific islands dwelt in a world whose utmost
possibilities to him lay in the adjacent islands within
view, and which his canoe could reach in a few hours’ sail.
The difference in culture between him and those whose
range of observation has been greater, must be immense.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
The compacted land division of the globe, the solid cluster
of continents, must be the source of stimulus and culture,
of which the isolated inhabitant of the Pacific islands knew
nothing, till commerce had at length linked the world together.
Only with the improvements in navigation could
civilization reach him. The European had to carry his
culture to the New Zealander, his antipode.</p>

<p>The ancients had little suspicion of all this. Yet the contrast
between the land world and the water world did not
escape Strabo’s keen glances, and he hints at its effects on
man. It is glanced at in one passage of his 15th Book. He
is speaking of the effect of the moist air of India in contrast
with the dry air of Libya, and shows that he appreciates
that these are not without their influence on the constitution
of the Indian and of the Ethiopian. “Some,” he
says, “rightly ascribe it to the sun, that, in the absence of
moisture in their air, the rays burn so deeply into the body
of the African; the Indian, on the other hand, is not jet
black and curly-haired, because, in his country, he enjoys
the moisture in the atmosphere.”</p>

<h3 id="heading10">The Position of the Continents and its Influence on the
Course of History.</h3>

<p>Besides the three great forms spoken of above—the compacted
land-mass, the great water-mass, and the subordinate
water-mass—the position of the continents leads us
to another discovery of prime importance.</p>

<p>The question arises, What relation have the continents,
taken separately, to the entire mass which they constitute?
What relation do they bear to each other? What influence
does the proximity of great land forms exercise?
What influence their remoteness from each other? Is the
arrangement of the continents fortuitous, or adapted to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
great ends always held in view by the Creator? Has
Nature been left in this to a wild, passionate caprice, or
has she been subjected to law, and been compelled to subserve
the interests of humanity? And is it not worthy
of study, worthy of science, to investigate these things, to
master their law, and observe here the workings of the
Divine Mind?</p>

<p>In the solar system, we have for a long time minutely
studied matters of size and distance, the approach and receding
of planets, and observed the effects of all these
things with an accuracy which could not be too thorough.
In the study of our Earth, this has been neglected, because
heretofore those great tracts of land and water have
seemed of little mutual influence; because they are fixed
forms. Yet they have a greater influence, perhaps, on this
very account. Although there is in them no law of gravitation
to study, yet there is in them the display of forces
no less surprising than those of attraction, and which are
to be read in the light, not of mathematics, but in the
light of history. It indeed seems self-evident that a grouping
of these great forms cannot be without an influence on
the progression or retarded development of nations; on
the amount of population, the progress of colonization,
and the union of States in offensive and defensive alliance.
Should a higher Power throw the continents out of their
present position and relation to each other, a new history
of the world would date from this day.</p>

<p>Here, then, is the primary element of history; the laws
of continental arrangement are the starting-point. Mathematics
has thrown a network of meridians and parallels
over the surface of the globe; but these lines exercise little
influence over the course of history. The symmetry and
regularity which they suggest do not belong to the earth;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
the earth is not bounded, like a crystal, by right lines.
There is a freer play than that mathematical mark of
parallels and meridians suggests; there is an interdependence
of the great land districts of the globe that these
regular lines do not indicate; a higher law of order,
evolving the most perfect results from elements seemingly
the most discordant.</p>

<h3 id="heading11">The Pyramidal Forms of the Great Land-masses, and
their Southward Direction toward the Oceanic Hemisphere.</h3>

<p>The great land-mass of the globe accumulates in size
as we advance toward the North Pole. South of 55° S.
lat., the continental form disappears, and the tracts discovered
of late years in the neighborhood of the South
Pole are apparently islands, or rather long ice-coasts,
whose continental form is very doubtful. The great land
division, embracing both the old and the new worlds,
reaches to about 80° N. lat., and the extreme points
come even yet nearer to the Pole. The distances of one
body from another, as, for instance, from Greenland to
Iceland, are very small, in comparison with the immense
spaces which divide the southern points of the continent,
where the hundreds of miles of separation at the north
expand into thousands. Expansion of the land-mass is
the law at the north, contraction at the south. The great
land formations terminate in wedge-shaped extremities,
a fact observed by Lord Bacon, J. R. Forster, and Steffens;
America ending at Cape Horn, 55° S. lat., Australia,
which may be considered to embrace Tasmania or
Van Diemen’s Land, at the southern extremity of the latter,
45°, and Africa, at the Cape of Good Hope, 35° S.
lat., respectively. Humboldt gave the name of “Pyramidal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
Structure” to this cone-shaped form of the great
land-mass, which, it will be observed, all are directed toward
the south. This pyramidal structure contributes
very much, unquestionably, to the diminished heat of the
southern hemisphere, and has given a great predominance
to the population of the northern in comparison with the
southern; and not in respect to number alone, but also to
mental and moral force of character.</p>

<p>But not the southern extremities alone of the continents
exhibit this wedge-like form; it is repeated also in the
northern countries of Europe and Asia. In Europe we
discover the working of the law in the peninsulas of
Spain, Italy, Greece, the Morea, and the Crimea, and also
in the great Scandinavian peninsula. The same phenomenon
is repeated on a scale far more imposing in Asia,
in the great countries of Arabia, India, and Farther India,
Corea, and Kamtchatka; also in both halves of America.
Exceptions are rare. In Great Britain, the pointed extremity
is toward the north, and the greatest breadth at
the south; but this is a peculiar case, and has its exceptional
causes; and perhaps with reason, for this island
has hitherto maintained an individual and exceptional
character in the development of modern civilization.</p>

<p>Various explanations have been offered for the almost
star-shaped figure which the combined body of great
peninsulas assume, radiating, as it were, from the center
of the land hemisphere. This is seen very strikingly in
looking at a horizontal projection of the northern hemisphere,
viewed from the North Pole. There has been
evidently the working out of some great design in this,
and the forces employed must have been of the first order
of magnitude. Clöden attributes it to the rotation of the
earth in its plastic, formative-state. Link ascribes it to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
electrical forces, generated at the time the earth’s crust
was hardening into its present consistency. J. R. Forster
finds an explanation in the theory, that formerly great currents,
now not existing, passed, or sought to pass, from
south to north or northwest. He attributes to these the
parallelism of the great gulfs which indent the coast-line
of the old world, the uniform abruptness of the shores at
the south, and the gradual widening of all the great land-masses
as we go north. The Atlantic is a channel cleft
by those great currents. Behring’s Straits is a smaller
one; but everywhere else the effort was incomplete, and
no opening was effected, except in the straits of minor
importance, which separate island from island, or from
the main land. The fossils discovered by Pallas seemed
to favor this theory, but later investigation has showed
that they do not.</p>

<p>Link overthrew Forster’s theory, yet the phenomenon
is worthy of study. Viewed on a map of the land
hemisphere, constructed according to Mercator’s projection,
it is a storehouse of interesting observations and
studies, and is to be recommended to the student’s careful
attention. We must pass over the theories; scholars disagree
as to the cause; Pisis ascribes it to a hidden law
of geometric construction; Necker, Brewster, and Dana,
to magnetism. We must simply accept the facts for the
present.</p>

<p>A careful study of the land surface of the globe suggests
interesting comparisons with what we know of the heavenly
bodies, Jupiter, for example, and our moon. Unquestionably,
the entirely different grouping of what seem
to be the great features of that luminary must have had
an influence on the whole course of history there. We
will not enter into speculations regarding this, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
referring the reader rather to the thorough investigations
of Beer and Mädler.</p>

<h3 id="heading12">Situation of the Continents in their Relation to Each
Other and to their Collective Whole.</h3>

<p>The relation which the continents bear to each other
arises, primarily, from their position in reference to the
cardinal points of the compass. This has been a principle
from the earliest times, and the great laws of population
may, in their working, be referred to this simple law
of grouping.</p>

<p>Asia was known as the Orient, or, in the apt and beautiful
German phrase, the Morgenland, or Land of the morning;
Europe and the northern rim of Africa, as the
Occident, or, in the German, the Abendland, or Land of
the evening. In the south lay the torrid regions of the
Ethiopians, in the chill north the country of the Hyperboreans.
This fourfold division of the earth was for many
centuries the only one known; the division into continents
being made, according to Herodotus, by the Phenicians.
And in very truth, a great principle lay in that
rude and primitive division; it was in entire harmony
with nature, and, up to the latest times and the opening
of a new world, in entire harmony with history also.
With Asia, the Orient, is connected indissolubly the development
of the ancient world; with Europe, that of the
modern. The contrast between these two great divisions
is wonderfully analogous to that of morning and evening.
The whole culture of the West had its root, its beginnings
at the East. The East is not merely the place where the
sun begins his daily course; it is the cradle of man, of
nations, of dynasties of every sort, in politics, religion,
and science. All the old royal houses came into Europe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
from the East; they are all “children of the sun,” no less
than the princely families of India and Persia. The West
merely witnesses the progress of what was begun in the
East. From the most ancient times onward through the
Middle Ages,—from Homer to Dante’s “Purgatorio,”—the
West is associated with the kingdom of the dead, with
“Hades,” and the “islands of the blest.” And within these
two great divisions of Orient and Occident are comprised
smaller ones, adapted to more limited conceptions of the
extent of the earth, but growing out of the same root with
the larger division. Bactriana and India constituted the
Orient to the inhabitants of Western Asia, Syria their
Occident; Asia Minor was the Orient of the Greeks, Italy
and Sicily their Hesperia; while the Romans called Spain
theirs.</p>

<p>Between the Orient and Occident, and yet to the south
of both, lay the Libya of the ancients, exposed to the sun’s
direct rays. In the very middle of the earth, on both
sides of the equator, and not at the South Pole, is the
true South. There we must seek the phenomena of the
tropical world in their culminations. As high noon, the
middle point in the hour, is the consummation of the day,
so the torrid climes of the equatorial belt, at the very middle
of the earth, afford the extremes of luxuriant growth.</p>

<p>The broad tracts of land at the northern polar regions
formed the true physical contrast to the Orient and the
Occident, as well as to the great South of central Africa.
They lay around the North Pole like a vast shield of earth,
unbroken except by the comparatively insignificant seas
and gulfs of that region. And even where the water
has broken its way and severed those northern lands, a
submarine volcanic activity is, even now, constantly at
work to restore the break, and bind the coasts together.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
At about 70° N. lat., all the countries of the north are
brought into great nearness, and that parallel is a highway
of little else than land crossing the North Cape of Europe,
Cape Chelagskoy, in Tchooktchee, at the northeastern
extremity of Asia, and touching Cape Bathurst, and
the Fury and Heckla Straits of North America. North
of this highway and of the Georgian Archipelago begins
the great group of circum-polar islands.</p>

<p>The break between Asia and North America, at Behring’s
Straits, is but fifty-six miles wide; it is the mere
outlet of the Sea of Kamtckatka into the Arctic Ocean.
The space between the northeast of America and the
northwest of Europe is much greater indeed, but, in
comparison with the distance between the southernmost
points of the old and the new world, insignificant. The
distance from northern Norway to Greenland is but about
940 miles.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that, at the north of the great continental
land-mass, where minor seas and channels break
through, great volcanic forces are constantly at work, as
hinted at above, to restore the unity. In the Sea of Kamtchatka
lie the Aleutian islands, extending more than 950
miles, and forming what has been happily termed a bridge
from the old world to the new. It consists of more than
a hundred rocks and islands, some of which have been
thrown up within the memory of man. In 1806, von
Langsdorf and Tilesius witnessed the emergence of one
of these, with a cone-shaped center, and about twenty
miles in circumference. Grewingk has counted more than
fifty volcanoes in activity within the limits of this island
chain. The Curile islands, more to the south, form another
similar volcanic group, extending from Japan to
Kamtchatka. In this range there are known to be at
least ten volcanoes, 10,000 feet in height.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>The same high degree of volcanic activity must have
formerly existed between Europe and America, for the
traces of it are still visible. And not the traces alone, but a
part of the same activity. And doubtless the shallowness
of the waters between those continents hints at the same.
More accurate explorations, then, will probably reveal multitudes
of mountains, thrown up by these submarine forces,
but not far enough to emerge and bear the name of islands.
Yet many have emerged—those which fringe the shores of
Norway, Scotland, and Ireland; the Orkneys, Shetland,
and Hebrides islands; the Färoe group, with their blistered
surface, their recesses, and volcanic rocks; Iceland, with
its hot springs; and Mount Heckla; Jan Mayen, with its
frightful craters, and the eastern coast of Greenland; one
island, Sabrina, in the midst of the Azore group; which
has had three upheavals within two hundred years, in
1638, 1723, and 1811,—all these plainly indicate the presence
of tremendous forces, active in the past as well as in
the present.</p>

<p>We thus fix the character of the arctic polar lands to
be a close drawing together. Europe has, fortunately for
itself, the least share in those inhospitable regions; only
her pointed northern shores fringe the shores of the
polar sea, leaving the great bulk of the great land-mass
of the north to the broad shores of Asia and North America,
with their neighboring island groups.</p>

<p>This polar world, as we may call it, in contradistinction
to the Orient and the Occident, is not separated from
more southerly regions by any great physical line of demarkation.
The arctic circle is a mere mathematical line
66½° N. lat.; it has no geographical character whatever.
The true polar world reaches in some places far beyond
this mathematical barrier, bringing all its characteristics<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
with it; while, on the other hand, it withdraws, at a few
other places, nearer to the Pole. Were the polar world
more broken up than it is by inland seas, and separated
from the great land-mass by broad channels, it would be
far more isolated in its whole character than it is. It is
this immediate contiguity of the polar world with the
great land-mass which opens it to whatever civilization it
may be able to receive. And there is the same unity in
the polar world that there is in the tropical world. The
same phenomena which appear in one part of it are repeated
in every other part. There are, of course, subordinate
modifications found, but everything essential, which
is discovered in one part, is discovered in every other part.
There is no distinction into “new world” and no “old
world;” the new world and the old coincide amid the
arctic pole.</p>

<p>The characteristic of the polar world, next to this of
unbrokenness, is the simplicity, or what might be called
the monotony of its productions and all its features; the
uniform reproduction of the same plants and animals, as
well as of geological forms. Even Lapland, which is the
farthest removed from the Pole of all the arctic regions,
manifests, in its rounded and polished granite and gneiss
and its deep and sharply-defined cuts, the same uniformity.
The syenite found at Lake Imandra displays the same
characteristics as that found on the islands in the White
Sea, and on the shores of Greenland. The tops of the
mountains, instead of being green, are all white with the
lichen, commonly known as reindeer moss. And as with
the geological formations and the vegetable kingdoms,
so with the animal kingdom. Elsewhere are found bears,
foxes, reindeer, seals, and walruses; the feathered tribes
partake of the general monotony of structure, and man not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
less. The range of his development is extremely limited,
and his character little different, whether in northern Asia
or northern America.</p>

<p>America forms the real West of the great land-mass,
the true Occident of the earth, young as yet, but to receive
as its gift the entire culture of the East, and to advance
by giant steps to a position of independent influence. Already
it has far surpassed Asia in industry and civilization.
The old world was the preparation for the new. Almost
everything which the new world enjoys and values was
the gift of the old. Its most ancient monuments of religion,
architecture, and art are closely linked to those of
the old world. Hieroglyphics have been found among the
Peruvians and the Mexicans. In like manner embalming
of princes, the engraving of astronomical data upon rocks,
were borrowed from the East.</p>

<p>The <i>historic</i> character of America is more striking in
respect to newness than the physical features of the water
hemisphere. Buffon supposed that the American continent
is of more recent formation than the old world, assigning
for his opinion that it is more submerged, because
smaller in area, than the eastern land-mass; because, also,
the plants which demand moisture are predominant over
those which depend on a dry climate; and because the
forms of homologous animals—the elephant, rhinoceros,
crocodile, turtle, apes, and serpents, for instance—do not
attain the same size as in Asia and Africa. But waiving
this, we use the name New World, only with significance
in its connection with history.</p>

<p>With the discovery of America begins a new period in
the history of man and of nations in their civil relations.
The enlargement of territory occasioned by it was not
greater than the enlargement of the bounds of thought.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
The old world had been developed earliest, had gone as
far as it could go; it had to wait till another great step
should be taken before it could go on in its course. The
highest progress of the human race, the complete development
of its possibilities, was not possible till man should,
in his wanderings from east to west, compass the globe,
and take possession of it, not for a day, but for all time.
The primitive settlements in Mexico, Peru, and Yucatan
could not sustain themselves in consequence of their isolation;
navigation was in its rudest stages, and it needed
to be in its highest before the world should be bound
together closely enough to advance in all its parts toward
the goal of a perfect civilization. Those primitive colonies
perished therefore, as Canaan perished before Israel,
and were replaced by others. The reason of this lay in the
isolation of the land-masses of the earth. Had America
been discovered and made accessible to the old world before
the diffusion of the Gospel and the establishment of
the Christian Church, it would have been too early, and
heathenism might have had its grandest triumph and its
loftiest temples in the new world. The way was not
open as yet for the high moral development of the race;
and the highways of civilization were not made till the
most modern times, when all was in readiness for the great
advance which we are witnessing now.</p>

<p>The contrast to the great continental hemisphere is
found in Australia, a land-mass of no insignificant size, situated
at the center, or very nearly at the center of the great
oceanic hemisphere, and surrounded by hundreds of groups
of islands, generally of quite unimportant magnitude.
The name Australia was fitly chosen; it indicates its true
relations to the Southern or Austral ocean. As Africa is
the true South to the eastern hemisphere, Australia is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
true South to the great continental land-mass of the whole
globe. As the earth has two magnetic north poles, and
two north poles of cold, one of the former in Siberia, north
of Lake Baikal, and east of Cape Taimura, 110° east of
Greenwich; the other in the neighborhood of Melville
Island, in North America, 102° west longitude from Greenwich,
so there are, in a physical sense, two south poles,
(we do not refer to the magnetic ones and the poles of cold,)
a continental south pole in Africa, a marine or maritime
south pole in Australia.</p>

<p>This country, the largest of islands or the smallest of
continents as we may choose to designate it, the most remote
of all the great divisions from the center of the land
hemisphere, has been the last to feel the pulses of civilization.
There, therefore, is to-day the most rapid, the most
amazing advancement to be witnessed on the earth; it has
crowded centuries into decades, and with its shores adorned
even now, in its youth, with states and cities, it cannot
longer be called a land left behind in the world’s advance.
It has inherited all that was finished in the knowledge and
culture of the continental world; what the people of that
world have toiled for years to win, becomes at once the
birthright of the Australians. It is only an instance of
the truth of Humboldt’s remark, that the more full the
world is of ideas, the more rapid is its progress—a remark
which throws the strongest light upon the connection of
geography with history.</p>

<h3 id="heading13">The Historical Element in Geographical Science.</h3>

<p>While so many a spot in the great continental land-mass
was once the home of a high culture, and from being a
cradle of arts and sciences has become a deserted waste,
the civil and political condition of many people in the remote<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
districts on the oceanic side of the globe has advanced
with unprecedented rapidity. The course of development
has been very different from what it was formerly. Distances,
natural influences, natural productions even, yield
always to the victorious march of man, and disappear before
his tread; or, in other words, the human race is
more and more freed from the forces of nature; man is
more and more disenthralled from the dominion of the earth
which he inhabits. The history of specific districts and of
entire continents confirms this.</p>

<p>The first inhabitant of the sandy valley of the Nile was
a dweller in a waste, as the nomadic Arab is to-day. But
the later and more cultivated Egyptians transformed that
waste, through the agency of irrigation and canals, into
the most fruitful garden of the world. They not only rose
themselves, but raised their own country, hitherto so sterile,
into a place of the first importance, and did it by the
simplest of means,—the bringing the water and the land
into more intimate relations. Through neglect and the
tyranny of successive kings, the fruitful valley sank again
into its waste condition. The district around Thebes
became a desert, the fruitful Mareotis a swamp; similar
phenomena occurred in many parts of Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>Another example of man’s subjugation of nature is
found in great mountain chains. During the first centuries
after Christ, the cultivated south of Europe was separated
from the uncultivated Celtic and Teutonic north by
a great natural barrier, the unbroken, untraversed Alpine
chain, which passed through all central Europe from west
to east. At the south lay the rich states of the old world,
beyond the Alps was the cold and barren north. But this
old formidable barrier has vanished, as the thronged cantons
of Switzerland and the crowded villages of the Tyrol<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
yearly bear witness; and they draw thousands of tourists
instead of repelling them. What a mighty change!
From Provence to Styria run the stately forms of the
Alpine chain; but the deep recesses and the lofty highlands
are thickly peopled, the forests are thinned, the obstructing
rocks removed. No longer a barrier between the north
and the south, as it was in the time of Julius and Augustus
Cæsar, Switzerland has become a country of stupendous
highways. The peaks which were once unapproachable,
and around which merely eagles idly flew, are now the
passes of Mount Cenis, the Simplon, Saint Gothard, the
Splügen, and Saint Bernard; while the snowy heights of
Ortler, in eastern Alps, now give place to a public road.
Over the Semmering Alp a railway even passes. Just as
the wild horse of Toorkistan has given up his freedom and
has become the tame and useful servant of civilization, so
this Alpine segment of the globe has changed all its relations
to the adjacent countries. The influence of the most
stupendous natural objects is weakened every year. The
physical dimensions may and do remain unchanged, but
their influence on life and on history is undermined by
those new conditions which operate so powerfully in freeing
man from the dominion of nature. The power of man
makes him master of the earth, and gives even the key to
the subjection of the grandest mountain chains into his
hands.</p>

<p>In further illustration of this, take the Ural chain, which
was and still is the eastern division line of one continent,
and the western barrier of another, but which has become,
since the days of Peter the Great, a grand center of labor
and commerce, a great avenue of civilization in its return
passage from Europe to Asia. And so everywhere, from
the wild Caucasus and the Himalayas to the grand Cordilleras<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
of America, the same progress is seen; man becomes
more and more the conqueror over nature. And
not in mountains alone, but in the great forest regions of
central Europe, in the primitive wilderness of North
America, and in the marshes of the Netherlands, does man
vanquish the forces which once fettered him. The once
fearful wastes of Sahara have become the track of caravans;
the sterile plains of Australia and California have
drawn great colonies to their gold mines; the ice seas at
the north have become, through the efforts of Parry,
Franklin, and others, the scene of heroic exploits and of
grand struggles of man with nature; indeed, the greatest
victories of modern civilization have been there, and the
playgrounds of polar bears and walruses have witnessed
the noblest humanities, and the loftiest courage, and the
most disinterested heroism of the age.</p>

<p>The continents and oceans have witnessed still greater
transformations. The seas were once the impassable barriers
of nations. The birds of the air only traversed the
great distances which separated shore from shore. The
metallic stores of the earth, the vegetable and animal
kingdoms were not transferred to any extent from place to
place; the sea brought nothing from lands remotely
foreign but drift-sand, cocoa-nuts, floating wood, ice masses,
and seaweed, swept by the great currents from shore to
shore. But now the seas are no barriers; they do not
separate the continents but bind them together, and unite
the destinies of nations in the closest manner. The great
improvements in ocean navigation have entirely changed
the relations of the entire globe. The isolated island of
St. Helena, which was for centuries at the very confines of
the known world, became, within the second decade of the
present century, a prison-house for the great European<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
robber, and lay guarded under the eye of Europe. The
Cape of Good Hope, which was for centuries the limit of
Portuguese navigation, has become a mere halting-place for
sailing ships and steamers. The voyage from England
to China has been narrowed, within one hundred years,
from an eight months’ to a four months’ sail. These great
changes have been mainly effected by the agency of steam.
Steam has transformed the smaller seas into mere bridges,
and England and France are securely joined, Marseilles
and Algiers; while Prussian Stettin is brought into proximity
with Swedish Stockholm and Russian Petersburg.
The voyage to America, that remote land, which before
the days of Columbus was as inaccessible as the moon,
was made by him in seventy days, but is now accomplished
in ten. Even Australia cannot be said to be distant; a
steamer needs but seventy-five days to reach it, and ten of
those are consumed on the Isthmus of Suez. No island
now lies beyond the world of commerce. The most active
traffic exists between places the most remote. The wool
and the wheat of Australia control the price of those
commodities in London, and the value of cotton in
America fixes that of woven goods and even of bread in
Europe.</p>

<p>The great rivers too have been curtailed of their relative
importance, and have been shortened by steam sixfold.
They can be stemmed too, which is an immense
gain, for in the primitive stages of navigation they could
only be sailed upon downward, from source to mouth.
In 1854, four hundred steamers traversed the Mississippi
and its branches, and came into contact with a region
one-third as large as Europe. The Indus, Ganges, Irrawaddy,
Nile, La Plata, and even the Amazon, the monarch
of rivers, which drains a country half as large as Europe,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
are now more or less open to steam navigation. The great
river systems of central Europe too are thoroughly navigated;
and Southern Germany, Trebizond, Mayence, Cologne,
and London may be grouped as neighbors. The
land-locked seas are reduced to insignificance, and their
shores are now covered with villages and cities, from the
Platten-See of Hungary up to the Caspian and the great
lakes of North America.</p>

<p>To sum all up in one word, the mighty influence of
Time on the geographical development of the earth is
displayed in the clearest manner. But this influence is
not the same for all localities on the globe. While there
are some people and some places which are left behind,
there are others which have made wonderful progress, and
have taken and now hold a foremost place. And such a
position is that of Europe at the present moment. Europe,
the most central of all continents, in relation to the great
land-mass of the earth, and also the one most equally
removed from the middle point of the great water-mass,
touches the whole remaining world at the greatest number
of points, and this, in conjunction with her remarkably
broken coast-line, so favorable to the purposes of navigation,
have given her her place of command, and have
assigned to England her evident role of mistress of the
seas.</p>

<p>And looking from the present to the past, we see that
as some great tribes of men have given the whole fruits
of their natural existence to the world for its future use, so
some places, and those of no insignificant size sometimes,
have conferred upon the world, the trust which they once
held, and now recede, as it were, from view. They were
great in the past, and the results of their greatness are
now incorporated in the world’s life. The earth is one;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
and through the agency of what we may call either time
or history, all its parts are in ceaseless action and reaction
on each other. Though some great districts seem now to
have no part to play, the element of time draws them into
the great cosmos; they once had a great share in the
world’s affairs, and the fruits which they brought to completion
are merely in other hands. The earth is, therefore,
as was stated in the introduction, a unit, an organism
of itself: it has its own law of development, its own cosmical
life; it can be studied in no one of its parts and at
no special epoch of its history. The past and the future,
the near and the remote, are all blended in a system of
mutual interdependence, and must be looked at together.</p>

<p>This is shown clearly in the past of Asia, and the
present of Europe and some parts of the new world, while
the history of all central Africa seems to lie wholly in the
future. Heretofore it has enjoyed no progress excepting
along its northern rim. The middle portion of the old
world has outlived its primitive ethnographical impulse,
and sunk back into a state of slumberous inaction.
Asia, to call this region by its recognized name, has projected
its own life from the center to the circumference; by
this I mean, that while it seems to be exhausted of its old
vigor, other countries inherited its power. The population
of Asia is much less than it was in the time of Alexander
the Great, much less than during the Mohammedan and
Mongolian conquests, when all the habitable parts of that
immense continent were bound together by highways of
commerce and travel. On the other hand, the coasts are
now of much more value and significance than they were
in ancient times, and navigation has dotted her sea outline
with splendid and populous cities. These seem, by reason
of the facilities which steam affords, to be brought near to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
Europe; while the natives who inhabit central Asia are
not only widely separated from the civilized world, but are
divided up and set against each other by religious and
political enmities of the most bitter kind. This is displayed
in its fullest force by the comparative inapproachability
of the great mountain chains, the Ural, the Taurus,
and the Caucasus, and yet more by the unchanged barbarism
of the central tribes, the hostile political relations,
lacking all of the amenities and mutual dependencies of
European policy, and the deadly antagonism of Mohammedanism
and Christianity. This last is the curse which
the natives of the earth have brought upon themselves.
It is the clashing of religious faiths which has put the
extinguisher on Asiatic progress, annihilated her enterprise,
and set her in her present isolation. Still this
barrier is not absolutely settled and for all time, but already
it shows that it is capable of some modification. The
politico-religious system of the Chinese is rending under
our eyes; the old bonds which Mohammedanism once laid
on Asia are now sensibly relaxed. The great highways of
travel through the country of the Euphrates and Tigris
and the extended archæological investigations of modern
times have operated mediatorially between Europe and
Asia; while steam navigation on the Danube has brought
Turkey, a hitherto undissolved Asiatic element in European
life, into closer relations with the great powers of the
West. The great missionary enterprise, too, of modern
times, has been laboring to remould the ideas of the
Asiatic nations, while navigation has operated on the
material and more appreciable interests of commerce and
industry.</p>

<p>There are no possible limits to be assigned to the
perfectibility of the globe as the abode of man; no possible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
bounds to his enterprise. The construction of a canal
through the Isthmus of Panama would bring the eastern
coast of Asia seven thousand miles nearer than it is
now to the Atlantic shores of America and Europe. By
saving the mere doubling of Cape Horn, one-third of the
periphery of the globe would be annihilated, so far as the
labor and expense of navigation are concerned. North
America would nearly double its resources when its Atlantic
and Pacific coasts stand in close connection and interdependence.
The projected canal at Suez would exercise an
unbounded influence over Asia in binding it anew to Europe.
The building of highways through the passes of the Ural,
the Caucasus, and Himalayas is yet to be accomplished;
and only now are great roads constructing over the Rocky
Mountains, welding North America together. The construction
of railways on the high plateaus of central Africa
will transform that vast undeveloped district, so rich in
resources for the future. The changes which art is yet to
effect on our globe are beyond all possible computation,
and it might be said, beyond any possible exaggeration.</p>

<p>We turn away from these glances into the future to
look upon the past, the long ages when men lived in rudeness
and ignorance, having no art, and knowing nothing
beyond the little tract where they were born, and to which
they remained chained. There was no binding of shore
to shore, and of continent to continent, through the mediatorial
agency of seas and oceans. And this gave to the
continents a far greater individuality than they have now,
and a much higher degree of apparent influence than now
when we cannot view them excepting as parts of the great
complex which forms the world. The wanderings of the
old nomadic races, the enlarging of the domains of culture,
the transfer of the natural productions of all climes, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
well as the traditional ideas of all lands, proceeded from
the central portions of the ancient world toward the
extremities. The manner of this progress, following as it
does the order of history, displays more clearly than almost
anything else the close dependence of all national development
upon geographical conditions, and their indissoluble
connection. Without this connection the order of historical
events would have been completely changed. In no instance
has there been self-evolved progress in the North, East,
South, or West; it uniformly began at the geographical
center, at the point of conflict between the Orient, the
Occident, and the tropical South.</p>

<p>Western Asia, northern Africa, and southeastern Europe
were the homes of the earliest culture, and it is to them
that all other parts of the world owe the light which they
enjoy, though they may have received it at second or third
hand. The territory of which I speak extended from the
highlands of India to Italy, and from the Nile to the Don,
including the valleys of the Euphrates and the Gihon.
This broad and fertile reach of territory has been the
fruitful mother of the world’s present thought and culture.
Nor must we overlook the fact that, despite what was
said above, regarding the oceans as the greatest barriers
to the spread of civilization, that smaller seas aided it, for
the very country of which I speak was intersected by five
important seas, and to them it is under immeasurable
obligations for its development. This Asiatic-Africo-European
belt has exercised the greatest influence on all
the course of human affairs, on all colonization, on the
differing of races and languages, and the arts of war and
of peace, over the habitable world. This territory lies
as the background of all the events of history, and has
given to every one its distinctive character and its appropriate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
place. Nor can we in the future dispense with the
element involved in this, of historical occurrences yet to
come dependent on past geographical conditions, although
this will be far less marked than it has been in the past.
It demands and will demand a far larger measure of
investigation and thought than it has yet received. Whatever
independent progress the New World and Australia
may seem to be making, and whatever interest they may
awaken in the minds of students, not even they can be
looked at without regard to their relations to the ancient
historical lands, the source of all the inherited culture
which they are enjoying in their vigorous youth. India,
Egypt, Palestine, Greece, and other countries still stand
out as the formative lands of all modern history, and we
cannot study the present without studying them. They are
to the student what Plutarch’s Lives are to the biographer,
the imperishable and unequaled models which gain new
luster as time rolls on. It is therefore not without reason
that ancient geography ought to be subjected to a more
systematic treatment than the geography of the Middle
Ages. The latter, though not unworthy of a large place,
had no relations of special importance to the whole world,
to the study of the physical conditions of the most imposing
objects of nature, to the connection as cause and effect
of events past, present, and to come.</p>

<p>From these foundation principles, we advance to a more
full study of the configuration of the surface of the globe,
for which we are now in a measure prepared.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PART_II">PART II.</h2>

</div>

<h3 id="heading14">A more extended Investigation regarding the Earth’s
Surface.</h3>

<p>It is the province of Hydrography to deal with the
oceanic world; Geography proper concerns itself simply
with solid forms. The Hydrography of the globe we must
pass over, however. Aside from the fact that it would lead
us into studies of the most protracted nature, it forms
strictly one department of nautical science. Besides, there
is the less occasion to speak of it here at length, that works
of great excellence have been published, relating to that
branch. We turn therefore to the land, and shall study the
world of waters only so far as it exerts influence on the
land.</p>

<p>By land we mean the islands as well as the continents,
for, as remarked before, the difference between them is
merely relative. To the land division of the globe, however,
belong all rivers and the internal fresh water lakes,
however large. The basis of difference does not lie in the
fact that one part of the globe is water, the other part land,
but in the fact that one is a tract of uniform evenness, the
other of constantly varying surface, the internal rivers and
lakes only being frills, so to speak, to the elevated region,
and not sharing the sea level of the great oceanic mass.
Uniformity of surface is then the chief characteristic of
the sea; a lack of it, of the land. A mathematical level is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
a thing unknown on extended districts, and an approximation
to it is very rare. Even the basins of former seas do
not display a perfectly level bed. The plains of North
Germany are characterized by this billowy rolling. The
flats along the Danube, in Hungary, and along the Po, in
North Italy, have really important deviations from a true
level, though the eye is not able to discern them. Milan
is four hundred feet above the Adriatic; but the eye does
not discern that it is not at the center of a plain as perfect
as the surface of the sea itself, and yet that plain does
shelve gradually away till the Adriatic checks and defines
it. Pesth is two hundred and fifteen feet above the ocean
level, yet the gradual decline to the Black Sea is undiscernible
to the eye. The immense plains along the Amazon,
even the celebrated llanos on the Orinoco, which Alexander
von Humboldt likens to inland seas of verdure, have a
not insignificant slope from west to east. The middle
point of these llanos near the City of Calabozo, about 100
geographical miles from the sea, he found to be 180 feet
above the sea level; far lower indeed than Milan or Pesth,
relatively, yet at a perceptible elevation. All of these
plains were once the bottom of the sea; the Adriatic laved
the base of the Apennines and the Cottian Alps, and the
Atlantic swept westward over the llanos of the Orinoco
and the Essequibo, having the Sierra de Venezuela on the
north and the Sierra Parima on the south, till it was checked
by the Cordilleras of Merida and Pamplona.</p>

<p>Depression and elevation, then, are the characteristics
of the land. They are both measured from the level of the
sea; their absolute altitude is reckoned from the imaginary
sea level, extended over the whole globe. Their mutual
relations to each other are determined from their relative
heights. The absolute elevation above the level of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
ocean can be determined in a number of ways. If the
heights to be measured are in the immediate vicinity of the
sea, a simple system of triangulation will effect it. If they
are removed from the sea, the difficulties are greater, and
increase according to the distance from the sea. The
heights of great inland mountains are determined by
complicated operations with the spirit-level, protracted
trigonometrical calculations, the unwearied and skillful
use of the barometer, and constant appeal to the boiling
point of water. The description of these methods falls
within the province of Physics.</p>

<p>As the determination of the heights of the loftiest
mountains could not be made before the appointments of
scientific explorers have attained to a certain degree of
accuracy and delicacy, the knowledge of them in former
times was almost wholly relative. The inquiries of La
Condamine, Saussure, and de Luc, in the Andes and the
Swiss Alps, are almost the only ones to be trusted among
those of the older observers. All unscientific travelers
without accurate instruments confounded absolute heights
with relative heights, and innumerable errors crept therefore
into the earlier text-books. It is only within the
most recent times that Hypsometry has attained to the
dignity of a science.</p>

<p>To meet and counteract the errors alluded to above, and
current in the loose language of popular speech, we shall
use a new and indeed arbitrary terminology,—arbitrary because
the data which mensuration will sometimes furnish are
now, in part, wanting. We will divide the earth not relatively,
but absolutely, into highlands and lowlands. The
great districts often met, whose elevations are very moderate,
we call lowlands. They are, for the most part, immense
plains, varied but little above the level of the sea.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
The great districts which inclose mountain ranges we call
highlands, and sometimes plateaus. True highlands can
often embrace very extended and elevated plains, and these
plains again may include hills and mountains. This does
not affect their character as highlands, which lies in the
fact of elevation rather than in more or less modified
variation of surface. There may be vast variety in the
physical manifestations of a great plateau district, entirely
independent of the relative effects produced by the distribution
of its surface into plains, rolling land, hills, and
mountains.</p>

<p>In the lowlands there may exist hills to some extent,
and these may even be combined in ranges, provided only
that they do not violate the uniform characteristics of the
district in which they are found.</p>

<p>The highlands are generally met with in the interior of
the continents; the lowlands at the coasts. Yet there are
exceptions to this.</p>

<p>In the transitions from lowlands to highlands there is
great diversity. We can speak of three distinct bases of
discrimination: a sudden and abrupt ascent; a rise in
elevation so gradual as scarcely to be perceived; and a
terrace formation. Yet in these there is a blending of
one variety with another; there is no place sharply
marked, where we can say that one form ends and another
begins. There are constantly found modifications of these
three transitional phases. The plains along the Indus
and the Ganges rise sharply to the plateaus of Thibet
The flat Pacific coast of South America is exchanged
with equal abruptness for the highlands of Peru. The
transition is a gradual one from the lowlands of North
Germany, along the Baltic and the North Sea, through
Saxony and Bohemia to the Bavarian highlands, north of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
the Alps. The Spanish highlands form a series of terraces,
increasing in height from south to north. The immense
plateaus of central Asia are also terrace formations,
of diminishing elevation, as they advance to Siberia; so,
too, are the eastern plateaus of Peru, falling off in altitude
toward the plains of the Amazon.</p>

<p>Just as varied are the heights taken from the sea level
of the leading plateaus. Yet they never rise to a point
of elevation comparable with those of isolated mountain
peaks or ranges. These attain, in no insignificant numbers,
the height of 24,000 feet, while some ascend thousands
of feet beyond that. In Mount Everest, of the
Himalaya chain, the loftiest summit yet measured (29,000
feet) is found; although it may be that future investigations
more to the south will disclose yet greater heights.</p>

<h3 id="heading15">Highlands.</h3>

<p>Continuous highlands or plateaus seldom attain an elevation
greater than a half or a third of the loftiest mountains;
the most elevated range in altitude, from 8000 to
12,000 feet above the sea level. On an average, they lie
about 4000 to 5000 feet above the sea. We take the last
height as a convenient point of demarkation between the
two classes of highlands—those of the first and those of
the second magnitude. It is an arbitrary point, of course,
and the division there must remain, without a natural base
to rest upon, till more results in Hypsometry shall have determined
the real point of average between the combined
lowlands and the combined highlands of the earth’s surface.
Meantime this division will be of great service to
us in enabling us to bring into a definite and appreciable
classification many facts which would otherwise not be so
well understood in their relations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<h3 id="heading16"><i>Highlands or Plateaus of the First Class.</i></h3>

<p>By plateaus of the first class, we mean those high, continuous
plains which lie at the elevation of more than
from 4000 to 5000 feet above the sea level. The extreme
height to which such plateaus rise is a fact yet to be ascertained.
At an elevation of from 4000 to 5000 feet the
highlands of the first class merge into those of the second.
The point of transition is, of course, very difficult to fix
with precision.</p>

<p>The high plateaus of Asia rise more than 14,000 feet.
They inclose the head-waters of the Ganges and the
Indus. All central Asia is a vast congeries of highlands;
but, as a body, they by no means belong to the most elevated
of the globe. They are colossal in their length and
breadth, but not in their uniform altitude. In the latter
respect, they are far more varied than is generally supposed.</p>

<p>The plateau of Thibet attains, in its whole great extent
of 1800 miles in length and 500 miles in breadth, an average
elevation of 10,800 feet above the sea level. In some
cases it rises, of course, much higher, as, near the holy
lake Manasarowar, for instance, where it is 14,000 feet
above the sea. Others sink, as at Ladakh, in Little Thibet,
to an altitude of about 9000 feet; so, too, Gertope, in the
region remarkable for its goats and the rich shawls manufactured
there, and Shiffke, are about 9804 feet above the
sea. The plateau of Great Thibet, east of Lassa, the
capital, and north of the Upper Brahmapootra or Yam-Dzangbotscha,
is 9000 feet in elevation. There are also
districts filled with mountain groups of great heights, but
where the depressions sink to the level of the valleys of the
Indus, Sutlej, Brahmapootra, as low indeed as 5460 feet,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
as at Cashmere, so that there is no lack of diversity in the
great plateau of Thibet.</p>

<p>The plateau of Mongolia, or more exactly the desert of
Gobi, can be ranked only on its lower edges, where it
touches the Chinese frontier, as of the first class, although
in extent it is twice as large as the great plateau of Thibet.
Only near the north bend of the Hoang-Ho and near
Peking does it reach an altitude of 8000 feet, and gradually
sinks away as it advances toward the northern frontier of
the Chinese territory, to 5100 feet, and farther north to
4000 feet; in the middle portions of the great table-land
it is depressed to a height of 2400 to 3600 feet; it rises
again at the head-waters of the Orkhon and the Toola to
an elevation of 4620 feet, and falls off in terraces toward
Kiakhta, near the northern boundary, where it is 1330 feet
high, Selenghinsk, on the Selenga, where it is 1632 feet high,
and Berch-Udaisk, where it is 1458 feet high, till it reaches
Lake Baikal, 1332 feet above the sea level according to
Humboldt, though Erman makes it greater.</p>

<p>Western Mongolia, (west of the meridian of Lassa, and
west of the point where the Tarine flows into Lake Lop,)
upper Bokhara, and upper Toorkistan were formerly considered
to be a highland district; this is now subject to
doubt. We shall discuss this further on.</p>

<p>Africa, too, has highlands of the first class, which, however,
do not rise to the extreme height of the plateau of
Thibet. As in Asia, so in central Africa, the old supposition
of the existence of a plateau of colossal extent has
been very much done away with by the more exact and
critical modern investigations. The strip of territory lying
between 4° and 10° north latitude has been demonstrated
by Barth and Vogel to be destitute of highlands. The
range of mountains announced as discovered by Mungo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
Park, and called the Kong Mountains, is proved to have
no real existence, and of course his statement fails of
verification that that range is the northern limit of an
elevated central plateau. The peaks which really do rise
in the Kong territory form no continuous ridge; they are
mere isolated groups of moderate height. Between these
groups the lowlands continue toward the south, in an unbroken
level, for an immense distance. How far south of
the equator the central African plateau begins, is yet unascertained,
for the snow-tipped peaks of Kilimandjaro and
Kenia, discovered by Rebmann and Krapf, in the parallel
of Mombas, 1° to 3° south latitude, are of immense height,
it is true, but they do not demonstrate the existence of a
plateau of the first class there. They rise out of table-land
about 2000 feet above the sea level, which Krapf explored
in the year 1849.</p>

<p>The Abyssinian plateau, on the contrary, takes rank
among the most elevated on the globe. At 10° north
latitude, south of the sources of the Blue Nile, lies Upper
Abyssinia, or the kingdom of Shoa, with its capitals,
Ankobar and Angolalla, 10,000 feet above the sea. Still
farther to the north, in the ancient kingdom of Gondar,
the German naturalist Rüppel ascertained the level of
Lake Tzana to be 7000 feet above the ocean; to the southward
of that the land rises to a still greater height, and
northward of Gondar the plateau ascends to an elevation
of 8000 feet, and mountains are met with 14,000 feet high.
The terrace of Axaw on the east is 6650 feet above the
Red Sea, which lies along its border.</p>

<p>To the south of Shoa lie the highlands of Kaffa and
Enarea. All travelers agree in the statement that the
inhabitants of that region are light-complexioned; and
Johnson draws from this the conclusion that the central<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
plateau must rise to a height of over 10,000 feet to harbor
people of a whiter hue than the dwellers of the less
elevated localities. He saw a number of men of light
complexion who came as far as from the fifth degree
south latitude, not from mountain homes, but from high
table-lands.</p>

<p>The plateau of South Africa rises at Lattakoo, in the
country of the Bechuanas, north of the Orange River, to
the height of 6000 feet. To the east, near the Snow
Mountains, where the river has its source, it ascends to an
altitude of over 10,000 feet. To the north, discovery had
made great progress since 1849. There, on a broad
plateau, Oswell and Livingstone brought to the knowledge
of the world the existence of Lake Ngami, whose surface
is 2825 feet above the level of the sea. The plateau which
includes this lake at its place of deepest depression cannot
be less than 3000 feet high, and at some localities yet
higher. Still more to the north, at latitude 14° south, on
the water-shed between the Zaire or Congo on the west and
the Zambeze in the east, the plateau reaches an elevation
of 5000 feet, according to Livingstone. Yet farther to the
west, it rises still higher and takes undisputed rank among
plateaus of the first class. There, at 18° south latitude,
Galtne, on his journey of discovery in 1850, ascended the
table-land of Ovompâ, a region of great natural productivity.
On the way thither, going from south to north, at 21°
south latitude, and therefore in the parallel of Lake Ngami,
but about 500 miles westward, he ascended north of the
Swakop River, the table-land of Demara, which he found
to be 6000 feet high. From that plateau mountains,
Koniati and Ometako, for instance, rise to a height of
8800 feet. From the Swakop River to Lake Ngami there
is a continuous plateau.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>The high table-land of southern central Africa does not
then extend, as was once supposed, as far north as 9°
north latitude, nor even to the later limit of 4½° north
latitude; but at about 4° 10′ the distinction between lowland
and highland seems to be sharply drawn, as the cataracts
which terminate the navigation of the White Nile
indicate. Here Father Knoblecher turned back in 1849,
but he ascended the first of the mountains which there
began to rise; his eye reached onward to mountains very
near or on the equator. He says that those high mountains
stand upon an elevated table-land. Thus, here at
the source of the White Nile we have a plateau seemingly
of the first rank. From such a plateau it is probable
that the snow-capped mountains, seen by Rebmann and
Krapf in the neighborhood of the equator, rose, which
they thought, approaching from the eastern coast, held
the source of the Nile.</p>

<p>At the northwest of Africa, too, at 10° north latitude,
the territory which feeds the springs of the Senegal and
the Niger is supposed to be a plateau of great elevation
and of great extent. But at present our lack of knowledge
prevents our attaining certainty regarding it. No
thorough system of measurement has been yet applied
there.</p>

<p>America possesses a number of plateaus of the first
class. To the most prominent of these belong the ones
which were first thoroughly studied by Alexander von
Humboldt. It is to him that we owe our first accurate
impressions of table-lands which, before his day, had been
indiscriminately confounded with mountains, and had had
no place assigned to them in the department of Geography.
Doubtless, too, great prominence was given to plateaus
at the outset; they were pushed into unseemly proportion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
to other matters as well worthy of investigation,
but they have come into their true place, and now only
wait the development of new facts regarding the size
and height of some, to be properly understood and
appreciated.</p>

<p>The measurements made in North, Central, and South
America give the following results; much more complete,
it may be remarked, than the results yet gained in Asia and
Africa.</p>

<p>To the plateaus of the first class belong in America, at
latitude 0°, the plain of Quito, almost 9000 feet above the
sea, (Los Pastos in the north being near 11,000 feet,) and
to the south, at 17° south latitude, the plateau of Upper
Peru. Here the great Lake Yiticaca is found, 12,000 feet
above the sea; eastward of the lake, the table-land rises
yet higher, and at Alto de Toleda it is 14,000 feet in elevation,
as high as the highest part of Thibet. At 20°
south latitude, south of Lake Yiticaca, is the City of
Potosi, whose streets are 12,822 feet above the Pacific.</p>

<p>In Central America is found, at 20° north latitude, the
extended table-land of Mexico, 500 miles wide, rising to a
height of 7000 feet, and farther to the north, in New
Mexico, the plateau of Santa Fé, 35° north latitude east
of the Rocky Mountains, and 7100 feet above the sea.
The table-land on the west side of the mountains, and
toward the Great Salt Lake, is undoubtedly just as
elevated.</p>

<p>Europe and Australia are wanting in plateaus of the
first rank, and in general the whole immense flat northern
districts of the globe, though we are not yet quite familiar
enough with the extreme north of America to speak with
entire confidence regarding it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<h3 id="heading17"><i>Plateaus of the Second Class.</i></h3>

<p>Elevated plains which are at once continuous and
bounded by a definite line of demarkation, and which do
not attain an altitude of more than 4000 or 5000 feet, are
considered plateaus of the second class. They are far
more general over the whole earth than plateaus of the
first class; in every one of the great divisions of the globe
they appear in the utmost possible diversities of elevation,
sometimes so gradually ascending that the lowest limit is
hardly to be perceived. This makes it not only expedient
but necessary to assign to plateaus a fixed though arbitrary
system of classification, for without it we could attain
to no thorough view of all their relations. This general
system must afterward be confirmed and justified by protracted
special investigations.</p>

<p>That not all the vast plains of Central Asia, from Thibet
to the Altai Mountains, and from the Belur range to the
Chinese Gobi, belong to the first class of plateaus, has
been demonstrated by the Russian measurements, made by
Fuss and Bunge in 1832, between Lake Baikal, Kiakhta,
and Peking, and rendered highly probable by the investigations
of Klaproth, Humboldt, and Zimmermann. Toward
the northwest the plateaus generally sink from the
moderate elevation of the Middle Gobi, 4000 feet, to Lake
Baikal, 1332 feet above the sea, Lake Zaison, not 1000
feet above the sea, and the border of the plateau at Choimailocha,
the Chinese frontier post on the Siberian line,
1000 feet above the sea, then to the lower border of the
plateau of Bookhtarminsk (936 feet) and Semipalatinsk
on the Irtish, (708 feet,) where the great Siberian plain
begins. In the valley of the Tarim and of Lake Lop,
pomegranates and grapes thrive, and cotton, which has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
been raised of an excellent quality in Eelee, is found at a
height of from 1200 to 2000 feet. And in contrast with
the great arctic plain of Northern Asia, not 500 feet above
the level of the sea, this central plateau will take its place
as distinctively of the second rank.</p>

<p>The plateau of Persia lies on the border of both classes;
for while the central portion touches 4000 feet, some parts
rise much higher and some sink much deeper than the
normal point. These balance each other, and the average
is about the maximum elevation of plateaus of the second
degree.</p>

<p>East of the Persian plateau lies the plateau of Cabool,
6000 feet above the sea. On the northern edge of Afghanistan
is the plateau of Bamain, 7500 feet in elevation.
More to the south is the high plain of Candahar, being
3500 feet, and the City of Candahar, 3264 feet above the
sea. The plateau of Kweltah west of the Bolan Pass is
5220 feet. Still farther to the south is the great plain of
Beloochistan, 7000 feet, with the City of Kelat, 5418 feet
above the sea.</p>

<p>In the central part of the eastern Persian plateau in
ancient Gedrosia, Drangiana, and Parthia, and Lake Zareh,
the depression is the lowest. At Lake Zareh the elevation
is 2100 feet; at Herat, more to the north, 2628 feet.
In West Persia, on the meridian of the Caspian Sea, it
rises higher; on the northern edge at Teheran it is
3672 feet; at Schabred, southeast of Astrabad, it is 4000
feet; at Kasbin, west of Teheran, it is 4000 feet; and at
Samegon, 5700 feet. The lowest depression at Com and
Kashan is not 2000 feet above the sea. Toward the northwest
Persia thrusts up a short arm into the adjoining territory
of Armenia. This is the highland of Ayerbaijan,
Zoroaster’s “Land of Fire.” This connecting plateau of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
7000 feet elevation belongs to the first class. To the west
of this the plateau of Armenia extends in varying range
of elevation, from that of Lake Van, 5124 feet, to the
plain of the Aras, (the ancient Araxes,) on which the
double cone of Ararat rises to a height of 14,656 feet.
But the table-land at the northern base of Ararat, the site
of Erdschmiazin, is only 2860 feet high, Erivan a little
higher, and Erdzeroune, on the plateau of the Taurus, the
plain of the Upper Euphrates, 5730 feet.</p>

<p>The plateaus of Asia Minor embrace wide plains extending
through the whole of the country, at an elevation
toward the east, in ancient Lycaonia and Cappadocia, of
3000 feet, and sinking toward the west to 2000 feet.</p>

<p>To the plateaus of Armenia and Lycaonia, Strabo,
whose home was there, and who carefully studied them,
gave the expressive name of ὀροπέδια, <i>i.e.</i> mountain plains,
a term which corresponds remarkably with our word plateau,
but which, as Humboldt has remarked, was not of
much use among the ancients. Strabo, however, directed
attention also to the Oropedia of Sicily and India.</p>

<p>In India, Deccan displays similar formations, which rise
gradually from south to north in Mysore, in Poonah of the
Mahrattas, and in the table-land of Vindhya and Malwah,
to 2000, 3000, and even 4000 feet. Deccan enjoys an admirable
climate and the richest abundance of all natural productions.
China too must have plateaus, for the Chinese
word <i>youen</i> indicates very clearly a large elevated plain.</p>

<p>In Arabia the plateaus of the second class are largely
found, and their height ascends from north to south, instead
of from south to north as in Deccan. The Syrian
Hauran is 2000 feet high, the plateau of Damascus 2200
feet, the plateau of Taif, above Mecca, 3000 feet, the plateau
of Sapaa, in Southern Arabia, 4000 feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>In North Africa that portion of the great Sahara which
has heretofore been considered a low plain, lying between
Tripoli and Lake Tchad, has been ascertained by the
German explorers, Overweg and Vogel, to be a table-land
of the second class, ranging in elevation from 1000 to 2000
feet. It begins at the Chorean plateau (2000 feet) in the
south of Tripoli, and sinks to an elevation of 800 feet in
the neighborhood of Lake Tchad. The average altitude
is about 1500 feet. This moderate elevation of Sahara
corresponds with the equally high plateau of Cyrenaica,
2000 feet.</p>

<p>The Atlas plateau, in the northwest of Africa, rises to a
greater height—2000 to 3000 feet; the upper course of the
Draa, near the Sahara, being 3000 feet; the high, broad
table-land on which Timbuctoo lies, according to Renon’s
measurement, is 1500 to 1800 feet above the sea.</p>

<p>In south Africa the low, or rather the moderate plateau,
which borders the district of the Bechuanas on the north,
rises, as it advances toward the lower rim of Africa, at Cape
Colony, to an altitude of 3000 feet.</p>

<p>America has many plateaus of the second range of elevation,
but her highlands of the first class are so imposing
in extent, as well as in elevation, that they have been
more carefully observed than the table-lands of the second
class.</p>

<p>Along the eastern slope of the Andes, on the same
parallel with the great plains of the Orinoco, the Amazon,
and the La Plata, these plateaus extend, touching the
base of the mountains, and appearing rather as terraces,
or vast plains of transition, from the highlands to the
lowlands, than as independent forms. Where Alexander
von Humboldt measured them, west of the low plains of
the Amazon, he found their height, measured from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
sea, to range from 1050 to 1200 feet; he describes them
as having the appearance of vast plains, and as differing
from the lowlands of the Amazon only in their greater
elevation; their slope toward the narrowing of the Pongo
de Mauseriche being too slight to be appreciable.</p>

<p>Between the threefold forks of the Northern Andes,
Humboldt ascertained the heights of ten plateaus, extending
as far as the plains of Orinoco, and called by the various
names, according to their elevation—Tierras templadas,
or temperate districts, Tierras calientas, or warm districts,
and Tierras frias, or cold districts—varying in height from
1800 to 6600 feet, the highest belonging clearly to the first
class of plateaus.</p>

<p>The mountains of Brazil are interspersed among plateaus
of the second class. The Brazilian mountains are
not true ranges, but lie in groups, their height varying
from 2700 to 5700 feet, and between them are the vast
elevated plains, called Campas, which are true plateaus of
the second class.</p>

<p>The southern point of South America, south of the
Rio Negro, as far as the Straits of Magellan, known as
the plateau of Patagonia, is a true table-land of from 1200
to 1400 feet in height. It is composed of ragged strata
of porphyry or of vast lava-masses, and has been explored
by Captain Fitz Roy, in 1837, from the mouth of the
Santa Cruz River to the snow-capped Andes in the west.
The plateau diminishes gradually in elevation from west
to east, till it touches the sea line.</p>

<p>In North America the broad plateau extending through
Northern Texas and the Indian Territory, and lying on
both sides of the Arkansas River, increases in elevation
gradually from St. Louis, on the Mississippi, less than 500
feet above the sea, to Santa Fé, on the upper course of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
Rio Bravo, 7000 feet above the sea. It ascends so slightly
that the rise is imperceptible to the eye, the broad plains
there taking the name of prairies. St. Louis is 420 feet
in absolute elevation; the eastern Arkansas plateau 1500
to 3000 feet; the high western Arkansas table-land from
3000 to 7000 feet, where, at the point of greatest altitude,
lies the City of Santa Fé, in the Territory of New Mexico,
7047 feet above the sea. This broad, sloping tract reaches
out to a great extent at the north, crossing the Missouri,
and embracing the colossal North American lakes. Lake
Huron and Lake Michigan, about 578 feet deep, and Lake
Superior, 627 feet deep, lie in vast hollows in that great
continuous plateau, which extends into the British Possessions,
rises again to 800 or 1000 feet in elevation, and
is rocky and craggy, yet not enough so as to take the
name of a mountain chain, but simply to form a clearly-marked
water-shed, which Fremont and Nicollet have
measured.</p>

<p>In Australia and Europe plateaus of the second grade
of elevation are not wanting. In Australia, however, they
are limited to the triangular district in the southeast,
which has become the place of settlement for the chief
English colonies, and which, bearing the name of King’s
Table-land, rises to a height of 2500 feet, and occupies
the largest area of all the Australian table-lands.</p>

<p>In Europe this physical feature is displayed most distinctly
in the Spanish plateaus, which occupy by far the
largest proportion of the entire peninsula. Madrid lies
on one of these plateaus, at a height of 2100 feet, five
times as high as Paris, on the Seine, and as high as Innspruck,
in the very heart of the Tyrol; Toledo, in the valley
of the Tagus, is 1734 feet above the sea. The average
elevation of New Castile, the central part of Spain, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
2000 feet. Old Castile, which borders it on the north,
separated from it by the Guadarrama ridge, is about a
thousand feet higher. Burgos, in the center, is 2700 feet
above the sea; Segovia, to the south, 3100 feet. The
average elevation of Old Castile is 3000 feet.</p>

<p>Then comes in natural order the Bavarian plateau, in
southern Germany, ranging from 1500 to 1600 feet high,
a broad table-land, on which lie Munich and Augsburg.
It extends along the course of the Danube from west to
east, from Lower Switzerland to Ratisbon.</p>

<p>According to the mean measurements of Humboldt, the
lower plateau of Auvergne, in southern France, is 1040
feet in elevation; still less in altitude (840 feet) is the
plateau of Burgundy and Lothringia, between the Vosges
and the Ardennes. Limousin, Aveyron, la Forez, Monts,
and Côte d’Or are plateaus.</p>

<p>The plateau of Lothringia, whose mean elevation is
648 feet, lies between the Rhine and the Moselle. The
plateau of Luxemburg extends northward to the Eifel,
where Prum lies, and to the Ardennes, where Malmedy,
Eupen, Namur, Liege, and Aix-la-Chapelle lie.</p>

<p>In Middle Germany, a series of plateaus of the second
grade begins in Upper Hesse, and extends eastward,
crossed by mountains and valleys, traversing Upper
Silesia and Galicia, and running along the northern side
of the Carpathian Mountains to Podolia, on the Dnieper,
thus embracing a strip extending through the larger part
of central Europe.</p>

<p>A line of plateaus begins still farther to the north, at the
low hills of Jutland, crossing Holstein, Mecklenberg, the
whole southern edge of Pomerania, and extending to
Lithuania and the Valdai Hills. It is characterized by
a band of inland lakes, whose basins it incloses, and is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
crossed by the valleys of the Oder, Vistula, Niemen, and
Duna. It has been called the Pomerania lake country.
In the hollows where the lakes lie, (whose surfaces are,
at the highest, not more than 300 feet above the sea,) and
yet more in the depressions, where rivers break through,
the level descends to as low a point as that of the great
plain of Central Europe; but at other places it rises to
an elevation as high as 500 feet, and so touches upon the
limits of plateaus of the second range. Many parts of
this broad upland may possibly be formed of shifting
sand dunes which have been gradually piled up along the
sea line. The plateau reaches its highest point at the
eastern end, in the Valdai Hills, where it averages 1000
feet in elevation. The highest point is 1100 feet. East
of the Volga, which rises at the eastern side of these hills,
the plateau falls off by imperceptible steps, till it is lost in
the great Russian plain.</p>

<p>In the peninsulas of Southern Europe, as in the Morea,
(2000 feet,) and in the Crimea, (800 to 1200 feet,) the
plateau again appears in not insignificant proportions.</p>

<p>The lower range of plateaus, it will be seen, is far more
frequently met with through all parts of the earth than the
higher, yet both combined occupy a larger share of the
surface of the globe. We can designate them as sharply
defined and broadly massive elevations, in contradistinction
to the long, narrow, and broken masses which have received
the name of mountain chains. The latter have too often
been confounded with the former and have received from
geographers a treatment disproportionately full in relation
to their claims. The plateau has been until recently an
almost forgotten geographical element. Humboldt restored
it to its rightful place; by many hundreds of measurements
he has accurately settled its form, its effect on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
climate, on isothermal lines, on agriculture, on the physical
and moral life of nations, and even on the course of human
history.</p>

<p>In closing this attempt at a general consideration of
plateaus, I must confirm the reproach which Humboldt has
cast upon most geographers of this day for their abuse of
the word plateau. And I must at the same time admit
that it is justly due to some parts of my own “Erdkunde,”
where I have considered the plateau systems of Central
Asia and Africa. When I wrote the pages of that work,
thirty and more years ago, there were no scientific measurements
then made of those regions, and the general
ignorance led to a premature generalization, in which I
used the ascertained features of the New World as probably
in analogy with the unexplored center of the Old World.
This use of really untrue analogies was carried by others
to great lengths, and choratographers went so far as to
depict the country according to the hypothesis of those
who had written at first hand, and after using all the lights
then existing, but who had never supposed that what they
had indicated in general terms, would be afterward made
so definite and real to the public eye. Those untrue statements
of my own, I must leave however just as they are,
and rejoice that the great advance of science has led to the
accurate knowledge of the great plateaus of which the
civilized world then knew but little. One word more: I
set the lower limit of plateaus of the second grade at 500
feet, lower therefore than the great master in Physical
Geography set his.</p>

<p>“Elevations of the soil,” says Humboldt, “which do
not display a marked difference in climate and vegetation
from the country around them, are not rightly called plateaus.”
His meaning is, that the name does not relate to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
absolute height measured from the sea, but harmonious
climatic relations existing between contiguous districts, one
of which is more elevated than the other. Highland and
lowland are therefore to him words of unfixed meaning,
if they do not stand in the contrast of height, climate, relief,
and rates of temperature. Humboldt therefore did
not consider the depression of Central Asia, at the Taringol,
as a plateau; and table-lands from 200 to 1200 feet
in absolute elevation, <i>i.e.</i> from the sea level, are passed
over by him as not worthy of the same name which he
applied to the plains 6000 to 10,000 feet above the sea.</p>

<p>Dealing as I do with the elementary features and the
physical contrasts of countries which for the most part are
now thoroughly explored, I prefer, for the purpose of elucidating
the subject of Physical Geography, to consider the
plateau as beginning at 500 feet above the level of the sea.
By comparing the plateaus of both hemispheres it is not
difficult to deal with a variety of features, and to make a
number of discriminations which, without an absolute
standard, it would be impossible to make.</p>

<p>We pass to the consideration of the much more varied
and more imposing characteristics of mountains.</p>

<h3 id="heading18">Mountains and Mountain Lands.</h3>

<p>Mountain lands cannot, in the strict use of language, be
compared with plateaus, except in way of contrast, because
they are not uniform, broad, and sharply defined tracts,
but extend in a linear direction, having as their chief feature
the longitudinal axis of the mountain chain. Groups
of mountain ridges may be separated from each other, or
may be united in any coherent way which does not make
them continuous, and yet, despite the want of continuity,
form a perfect whole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>Mountains, with their fissures, chasms, abysses, valleys,
ravines, clefts, precipices,—in a word, their varied diversities
of feature, broken through in every direction, the
whole chain rent into fragments by these transverse breaks,
are in direct contrast with plateaus. They have quite
often a common range of elevation, which, measured from
the sea level, is not unfrequently much greater than the
districts lying at their base. Yet this relation is only incidental,
it is not essential. There is no necessary connection
between the height of the outlying plateau and
the height of the mountain range. In Switzerland the
mountains rise to the altitude of 13,000 or 14,000 feet; the
country at the foot of the Alps is but 1000 to 2000 feet
above the sea. Here the distance between the summit
and the plateau at the base suggests no relation between
them.</p>

<p>The distinctive characteristic of a mountain land is the
height of isolated groups. Great differences of elevation
within small distances characterize mountain regions;
small differences within great distances characterize plateaus.
The plateau depends upon uniform evenness of
surface, or an approximation to it, over a large extent of
territory. The mountain range is the exact opposite, the
development of all kinds of extremes within a limited
space, and the consequent individualization of the locality
where it stands. Mountain lands cannot therefore be
identified with the type of the highland and the plateau.
The mountain chain has a character of its own, whether
existing in unbroken unity, or subdivided into subordinate
ranges, ridges, and spurs, and whether the summits are
conical or sharply pointed,—whether also of moderate,
medium, or loftiest elevation.</p>

<p>And high as mountains rise, their height is equivalenced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
by the depth of the depressions which form their valleys;
the higher the mountain, the deeper the abyss which
cleaves to the base. The immensely elevated peaks
of the loftiest chains find their correspondence in the narrow
ravines and the mountain lakes at the foot; the precipitous
summits of the great American chain have their
barrancos in the Andes and their cañons in the Rocky
Mountains. The valleys are in natural contrast with the
summits. They have just as little of the uniformity of
lowland plains as the mountain tops have of the uniformity
of elevated table-lands. They are infinite in variety, highly
individualized, and always adapt themselves to the characteristics
of the chain which conditions them. The mountain,
too, has no uniformity in its character; it embraces
within the smallest compass the production of all climes,
and unites the characteristics of both highland and lowland.
Mountain regions have therefore had a great influence in
history and in the development of humanity, even greater
than the more monotonous plateaus, which in general
harbor nomadic races and give little encouragement to
permanently settled people. For this reason the geographer
cannot, like the geologist, classify high table-lands
and mountains together; he cannot draw the same inferences
from the plateau as from the mountain range; to
the geographer the plateau is not a lower type of mountain,
but the two, in their relations to man and to history, suggest
entirely different results and condition entirely different
processes.</p>

<p>And yet it must be confessed that mountains do stand
in intimate connection with plateaus of both classes, and
that the transitions from the one form to the other are
well worthy of study. Yet the present lack of correct measurements
has made this little understood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>It is not the element of height alone which gives mountains
their significance. There are many other features,
which are little studied, yet of real import. It is, however,
not a matter of indifference whether a chain thrusts up its
peaks 1000, 5000, 10,000, or 20,000 feet, and the height
has been made and will continue to be made a subject of
careful investigation. In reference to height, we distinguish
what, in a general sense, we call mountains,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> into hills,
mounts, and mountains of various degrees of magnitude.
Yet the height of the highest range, in comparison with
the diameter of the earth, is insignificant, only about ¹⁄₁₇₀₀,
and the combined mass of mountains are of no more account
in comparing them with the entire mass of the globe,
than the roughnesses on the rind of an apple, or perhaps
more exactly still, than those on the shell of an egg. The
combined mountain systems in the world would not suffice,
if transferred to the North and South Pole, to fill out the
earth to such an extent that the polar and equatorial
diameters would be equal.</p>

<p>In following out his profound scientific investigations,
Alexander von Humboldt, in order to ascertain the center
of the earth’s gravity, taking into account the existing
elevations above the ocean level, was led to the conclusion
that too great importance was formerly assigned to mountains
in their relations not to the course of history, but to
the earth as subject to mathematical laws. Very careful
observations revealed the fact to him that all the mountains
of France, if reduced to a level and spread out, would
raise the grade of the whole country to a height not more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
than 816 feet above the sea line. All the mountains of
Europe, distributed in like manner, would raise the level
to only about 630 feet. In Asia the same process would
make the vast plain only 1080 feet high, in North America
702 feet, in South America only 1062 feet; while the
mountains of the entire globe would raise the level to only
947 feet above the level of the sea. So insignificant are
the combined mountain systems of the earth in respect to
size, in comparison with the immense body on which they
stand, though their importance is great when we regard
their influence on the localities where they are found.
Yet in this last regard, mountains deserve careful study,
for they not only exercise and have exercised a great influence
over nature and man, but they serve as our best key
to open to our view the internal structure of the earth.</p>

<p>Some mountains, though of great height and broad base,
like Etna, Vesuvius, Teneriffe, and many volcanoes, belong
to no true mountain system; and even when they
lie near together, and yet have no inner principle of unity,
they are not spoken of as a chain or a range: they make
merely a mountainous district. It is the repetition of the
common type and the existence of a continuous valley
which gives a right to use the names chain and range.</p>

<p>The linear extent and height of mountain ranges vary
very much; no definite limits to these can be assigned.
Yet there are few chains which are less than 25 miles
long and 1500 feet high. Other features are necessary in
order to determine the strict application of the word chain
or range; one is a ridge-like or comb-like aspect; (that
it should be a water-shed is not essential, although very
common;) another feature is that the rock composing it
should be of the same geological formation. Sand
dunes, although occurring in regular and ridge-like uniformity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
like those in Holland, and looking from a distance
like a mountain chain, are not to be reckoned as mountain
chains, though like the tells on the Syrian steppes and
dunes in the Netherlands and along the Baltic coast, they
sometimes rise to the height of a thousand feet. In South
Germany and in the neighborhood of lofty mountains, such
elevations are called mere hills; at the north foot of the
Alps, yet greater heights are almost always called level
land. In judging of the fitness with which the word
mountain is used, it must always be remembered whether
he who employs it dwells among the Himalayas or on the
lowlands of eastern Europe; and in order to give any
fixedness to the use of the word, it is necessary to take
into account other physical characteristics besides height.
By common usage, however, the Alps have become the
standard of comparison for all the mountains of the world,
mainly because, besides having their imposing height, they
are found in the middle of the temperate zone; they are
the most convenient to study of any great system on the
globe. In respect to height, we divide these into four
grades: the lowest from 2000 to 5000 feet above the sea;
the next from 5000 to 8000; the next from 8000 to 10,000;
and the highest from 10,000 on to the height of Mont
Blanc.</p>

<p>Another standard might be found in the colossal Himalaya
chain of Asia, and the Cordilleras of both Americas,
which could easily be brought into unison with the
Alpine chain of Switzerland.</p>

<p>The linear direction of a mountain chain, the axis of elevation
as we might say, (so sharply hinted at in the very
word mountain-chain,) brings out relations which vary
not only according to the longitudinal direction itself, but
to the lateral extent, the number of mountains, the situation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
and the ramification of the chain. If the direction be
a straight one, we can rightly speak of an axis of elevation.
According to Humboldt’s measurements, this axis in the
Pyrenees is 230 miles in length; in the Alps, from Mont
Blanc to the Hungarian frontier, 515 miles; the Ural Mountains,
550 to 2042 miles; the Scandinavian Mountains, 1100
miles; the Altai Mountains, 9900 miles; the Kuenlun,
1600 miles; the Thian-Shan, in Inner China, 1700 to 2150
miles; the Himalayas, 1600 miles; the Yablonoi Chrabet,
550 miles; the Aldan, 400 miles; the Ghauts, 760 miles;
the Andes of South America, 4400 miles; and the whole
Cordillera of North America, 9200 miles. There is often
much doubt about the true beginning and ending of a
mountain chain, and judgments differ according as they
rest on the fact of elevation or on the geological traces
of upheaval where they begin to be manifest. Geographers
are not agreed, for example, whether the Ural Mountains
continue as far north as Nova Zembla, and whether
one or two chains in America are to be spoken of as traversing
the plateau of Mexico.</p>

<p>If there are parallel ranges, it is correct to speak of a
transverse axis, running at right angles with the main axis.
There is, it is apparent, a marked difference between simple
chains and the accumulated parallel chains, where breadth
is a prominent element, as in the Vosges, the Black Forest
Mountains, the Fichtel range, the Hartz, the Ardennes.
The parallel rows form a mountain system. Yet all great
chains are made up of smaller ones, of groups at least, and
so are mountain systems. Often the grouping is seemingly
irregular, a lawless aggregation, but only because
our knowledge is incomplete, and the law of arrangement
concealed from us. This law is traced in the very geological
qualities of the chain, not in the later form. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
outer form is often very deceptive, the very convulsions
which indicate the surer signs having served to obliterate
what we should suppose the most prominent marks. The
present of mountains must often be studied in the light of
their past. Orography must be interpreted by geology.
But the geological surveys of the earth are as yet very
imperfect; the outer form has often to be accepted as the
only guide. Orography and geology are two sciences which
now go on hand in hand.</p>

<p>In the simple mountain chain it is easy to discriminate
between the parts which make it up; the base is easily
ascertainable and the ascent to the comb-like ridge is
readily traced; the eye does not fail to see the relation between
the special prominent heights and the chain from
which they rise, and to trace the manner in which spurs
and outlying mountains are connected with the main chain.
Small isolated collections of mountains are especially valuable
as elementary studies, for they always have a unity
of their own. And all the greater and well-known chains
are made up of smaller, simple chains, whose connection
and mutual relations are, however, sometimes exceedingly
difficult to trace. But the character of the whole is not
sometimes ascertainable with this preliminary knowledge
of the parts.</p>

<p>The true base of a mountain chain, the line of periphery,
in consequence of the general unevenness of the adjacent
country, must be ascertained by very exact measurements
with the level. The geologist does not begin with this
step, he strikes deeper, and seeks the place where the
structure diverges from that of the more level land lying
near; and, in the search after the basis of structure, he
discovers the unity of the range from the foot to the summit.
The whole geological district which has been upheaved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
into mountains, Leopold von Buch found to be
generally ellipsoidal in form, the longer axis being far
more prominent than the shorter one. The axis of most
mountain chains is, then, the longer axis of an ellipsoid.
The Swiss Alps display about a dozen such ellipsoids, of
different characteristics, and arranged according to no perceptible
law of harmony. Each is developed from its own
base, as the trunk of a tree grows out of its root. These
separate bases lie contiguously, but the peaks which shoot
up are widely sundered. The forms of the mountain
groups resulting from this are, of course, various. Some
of them I will briefly characterize.</p>

<p>1. The longer axes of the subordinate chains may run
in parallels, as in one portion of the Swiss Alps, the Jura,
the Ural Mountains, the Mexican Cordilleras, and the
Himalayas.</p>

<p>2. The chains may diverge or converge. The Alps diverge
at the east, and the forks run northeast and southeast
respectively; the Rocky Mountains, toward the Arctic regions,
divide into from five to seven diverging chains. Converging
ranges may come together at varying angles, and
these can mass themselves into confused mountain knots,
the summits of which soar to amazing heights, as the
West and Middle Alps do around Mont Blanc. Alexander
von Humboldt distinguishes five of these mountain
knots in the Andes, Porco, Cuzco, Pasco, Assuay, and Los
Pastos, whose construction, carefully studied, he considered,
gives the key to the structure of the whole chain.
Side chains often display this knotted form, as in Upper
Peru around Lake Titicaca, the three branches of the
Ural, at the Irmel Tau, the Himalaya, Kuenlun, and Hindoo
Koosh chains, in upper Afghanistan, and the ranges
of Swiss Alps, which converge around St. Gothard. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
the convolutions which these mountain chains make at
their point of convergence are never regular, never mathematically
exact, but to be measured in sections, and the
traces of a linear direction to be carefully sought with the
compass. The whole has, to the eye, a labyrinthine appearance,
and the law of structure is only ascertained, with
exactness, by the geological features, the direction of the
strata, and the like. The geographer must call in the
geologist to help him solve his problems.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>3. If from some high central point the mountain ranges
radiate in the form of a star, they form a new variety of
system called, for convenience, by the name “star-shaped.”
In volcanic mountains this configuration is common, as in
Mont d’Or and in Auvergne. The southwestern Alps,
known sometimes as the Sea Alps, the Ural at the Arctic
Ocean, the Quito range of the Andes, are types of this
form.</p>

<p>4. The ring-shaped system is in direct contrast with the
last. It is found where mountain chains are arranged in
a circle, inclosing a plateau of larger or smaller extent.
There are two marked examples of this form in Europe:
Bohemia and Transylvania. The ring of mountains
around the former is made up of a number of ranges,
which dovetail together at the ends, making a unit, but
only a rude circle, speaking with mathematical exactness.
The inclosed basin is only relatively a lowland; it is rigid
with hills and low mountains, yet of such little importance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
in comparison with the rim of peaks, that the common
name, the “Bohemian Kettle,” has begun to have an accredited
significance, and is stronger than the more loosely-used
word Basin. Transylvania, too, partakes of similar
characteristics. Its border consists of a number of minor
ranges, of varying heights, up to 1800 feet; and the central
hollow, which is much more strongly marked by hilly land
than Bohemia, lies 2200 feet above the Adriatic. The ring-shaped
system is one of the rarest met of all. They are,
however, observed in abundance on the moon.</p>

<p>5. Just as rare is the form where ranges intersect in the
form of a cross, those running, for example, from north to
south, meeting those running east and west. As an instance
of this, Humboldt cites the confluence of the Himalaya,
the Kuenlun, the Hindoo Koosh, and the Belor or
Belurtagh Mountains. The belt between 35° and 40°
N. lat. is remarkable for its gridiron-shaped mountain
system, the points of conjunction being marked by knots
of peaks of colossal height. The most remarkable one of
these is the lofty Pamir Pass, between 37° 30′ and 40° 5′
N. lat., and 18,000 feet high, known, historically, from the
sixth century, and described by Marco Polo, as well as by
the ancient Greek historians. The Persians dwelling in
the neighborhood term it the Roof of the World. Elsewhere
the same feature is observable, though on a scale of
less magnitude. So in the Altai range at Lake Yetzkoi,
in the western Swiss Alps, and in the porphyritic chain
of Room-Elee, known to the ancients as Rhodope, and
now as the Despoto Dagh. This gridiron-shape of some
mountain systems seems to be the result of upheavals at
different times, which necessarily occasions the most broken
configuration at the point where a chain of more recent
formation has been projected through one of older date.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>The varying relations of length, breadth, direction, connection,
and severance of mountain ranges give great
diversity to them, and impart to every system a character
of its own. To the features just indicated must be added
vertical or precipitous descents, for the influences which
they exert upon the possibility of man’s constructing
mountain roads, are very great. The extent of these
sudden depressions, or, more exactly, the relation which
the distance from the base to the pass bears to the distance
from the base to the summit, gives a key to the uses
of certain mountains as adjuncts of civilization, and shows
how some ranges rather than others may become the abode
of men, and produce marked effects on human culture and
the world’s history.</p>

<p>I have before alluded to the comb-like structure of most
mountain chains. The resemblance is more striking than
may appear; for not only do the peaks correspond in general
uniformity of height with the teeth of the comb, but
the equally uniform height of the passes from the base
corresponds with the uniform thickness of the solid part
of the comb. The relation, however, of the distance from
the base to the passes, to the distance from the base to the
peaks, is widely various. Humboldt has estimated it in a
few leading chains as follows:—</p>

<p>In the Alps and Caucasus the relation of the height of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
the pass to the height of the chain is as 1 to 2; in the
Himalaya, Quito Cordillera, and Alleghany Mountains, as
1 to 1·8; in the Pyrenees and Cordillera of Bolivia, as 1
to 1·5. In the Alps, therefore, where the pass is only
half as elevated as the chain, the communication is the
most direct, and the least barrier is put to the purposes
of man,—a fact of great import in relation to human culture.
The Pyrenees are in direct contrast in this respect,
the most unapproachable, the most sundering of mountains.</p>

<p>The position of mountain chains is a matter of the first
importance in relation to the welfare of man, and the
solution of many of the most important problems in history.
Whether interior ranges like the Ural and the
Atlas, or ranges connecting two seas like the Caucasus,
or those like the Mexican Sierras, lying between two
oceans, are most open to human approach and use, is a
question which we will not here stop to consider; but it
may be said that, whether situated in the relations just indicated,
or whether they are meridianal ranges like the Ural,
the Scandinavian chain, the Alleghanies, or the great Cordillera
of both Americas, which extends from the tropical
world to both polar zones; or whether they run in the
same direction with the parallels of latitude, turning one
side to the colder north, and another side to the sunnier
south; or whether they assume a diagonal direction like
the Swiss Alps, from southwest to northeast, or like the
Caucasus, from northwest to southeast, is a matter of the
first importance to ascertain. Of not less consequence is
it to discover whether the chain is the edge or rim of a
plateau, and can have, therefore, only a one-sided development,
like the Himalayas toward the south, or the Anti-Taurus
toward the north, because the existence of a plateau
on the reverse side dwarfs the slant distance, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
gives but a fractional part of what, without the plateau,
would be open and clear.</p>

<p>As plateaus usually display this edge on both sides, the
border has been aptly compared to a double ledge or rim,
between the two sides of which the table-land lies, often
tolerably high above the sea level. If these rims, like
mountains, are not contiguous to the plateau; if they are
separated from it by a valley of greater or less width and
depth, running parallel with the edge, they form what
Humboldt has called natural circumvallations. Of such
the Altai range, on the north side of the Asiatic central
plateau, is an example. The hollow between the range
and the plateau just mentioned is partly filled with inland
seas. The Caucasus may, in like manner, be regarded as
the circumvallation of the American plateau, separate
from it by the Koor and the Aras (ancient Araxes) rims.
Yet in the Caucasus another modification occurs—a partial
linking of the plateau with the range at the west extremity,
by the connecting chain of the Moschic Mountains.
In like manner the Pyrenees, in their eastern half,
form a circumvallation around the north side of the Castilian
plateau, separated from it by the basin of the Ebro,
and forming a perfect ring around Upper Castile and the
elevated province of Biscay.</p>

<p>In cases where a mountain chain rests upon a plateau,
rising up in the very heart of it, its summits seem to be
not high, although the basis, the true foot of the chain,
may not be at the level of the plateau, but far lower, and
such mountains may, therefore, be of great absolute height.
The name superimposed mountains has been given to them.
Such are the Kuenlun and the Thian-Shan ranges of Central
Asia, the Guadarrama chain between Old and New
Castile, and the Rocky Mountains in North America.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
These superimposed ranges often run near to and parallel
with the rim or edge of the plateau, and seem to give it
more completeness and breadth.</p>

<p>The geologist employs the word “sutures” to designate
such forms, because they serve to unite those parts of a
plateau which are at different heights above the sea level.
He regards the mountains as rising to fill enormous clefts
which great convulsions have rent in the earth, and as
passing up, while in their fluid state, to a height above
the level of the plateau, and bridging over the abyss. In
this way our mountains which rest on plateaus seem to
have been formed, as indeed is indicated by their geological
structure.</p>

<p>The smaller plateaus display analogies kindred to those
seen in the larger superimposed mountain ranges. The
extinguished volcanic group of Auvergne rests upon the
central plateau of southern France, which, according to
Remond, has an average elevation of 1000 feet. The now
silent volcanic group of the northern Rhine broke through
the moderately elevated gray-wacke formation of that locality,
and is, therefore, a superimposed range.</p>

<p>Mountain chains which diverge from plateaus and their
serrated rims seem, nevertheless, to have some relation
to them, even though they cannot be considered continuations
of them. The Lebanon chain, for instance, which
turns away at a right angle from the Taurus range, and
runs southward through Syria and Palestine; the Lutznetskia
and the Alatau Mountains, mineral ranges running
from the Altai northward to Tomsk; the Yablonoi and
the Stanovoi Chrabet ranges running to the northeast;
the still unknown or little known range of Farther India,
traversing the whole peninsula of Malacca, come under
this head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>Completely unlike the groups thus far considered, are
the isolated mountain systems, with uniform slopes on all
sides, and with a roof-like form, distinguishable to the
base. The mountains of Europe are mostly of this class—the
Ural, Carpathian, Scandinavian ranges, the Alps,
Apennines, and, in part, the Pyrenees. They give rise to
rivers, not on one side alone, as do the Himalayas and the
Andes; they are rich in resources of all kinds for the student
and the economist, and thus make up in part for their comparatively
unimportant dimensions. Their double-sidedness
gives them a large influence on civilization, since rivers
flow from them in all directions; while from the Himalayas
they only flow to the south, and from the Andes to the
east.</p>

<p>Plateaus and mountains, different as they are in appearance
and characteristics, yet constitute, in their mutual action
and reaction, and in their forms of transition from the
one to the other, the highland system of the globe. Their
relations are inexhaustible as Nature herself. We cannot
study them without profit; but we can never come to a
perfect knowledge of them all.</p>

<h3 id="heading19">The Relations of Plateau Systems.</h3>

<p>Like mountain systems, plateaus are not to be estimated
in respect to elevated and superficial area alone, but in respect
to form and position as well.</p>

<p>The American plateaus are elongated from north to
south, but are of disproportionate breadth from east to
west. The Asiatic plateaus, on the contrary, are not only
of great length, but also of great breadth. The Spanish
plateau, that of the Atlas system, and that of Asia Minor
have their length and breadth nearly equal.</p>

<p>The surface of plateaus is exceedingly varied. It sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
assumes the aspect of elevated plains, sometimes of
rolling land, sometimes of horizontal strata of naked rock,
as in Patagonia and the western Sahara. In one place it
displays sand-hills, as in parts of the Gobi Desert; in
others barren steppes, as in portions of Persia. Sometimes
we find a gradual ascent of minor plateaus or terraces;
sometimes single mountains rising out of the plateaus,
as does Demavend; sometimes we find a chain of
colossal peaks emerging from the heart of a plateau, like
Thian-Shan and Bogdo-Oola. Sometimes there are plateaus
broken up into crags and patches of level ground,
like Persia; sometimes plateaus with deep valleys or river
basins, like the plateau of Yoorkistan and Gobi, including
the River Tarim, and reaching its greatest depression at
Lake Lop, or, like the plateau of Afghanistan, including
the River Hirmend and Lake Zareh; again, we have plateaus
traversed by water-courses which forced their way in
times of flood, and leave in the rainless seasons the traces
of the former violence. Such are some of the less elevated
plateaus of France and Bavaria.</p>

<p>Especially important are the combinations and groupings
of plateaus, as well as their relation to adjacent lowlands.</p>

<p>In Africa the plateau form embraces the larger southern
half of the continent. Low plains are, on the contrary,
the prevailing form in the north, broken, however, by the
Sahara, and the high coast plateaus of the Atlas range,
and of Barca.</p>

<p>In Asia there is a vast central plateau with gradual declivities
toward the east, toward Yoorkistan and Persia
on the west, and toward Lakes Baikal and Zaisan on the
north. On the south the descent is abrupt to the Indian
lowlands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>In Europe there are, for the most part, scattered and
disconnected plateaus of small size and little elevation,
often passing by an imperceptible gradation to the other
forms. The Spanish plateau is, however, a marked exception,
and has the sharply-defined character of the
northern African plateaus. In eastern Europe the central
situation of the isolated Valdai plateau, whose elevation
is very moderate, but 840 to 1080 feet, is remarkable, and
is of very great influence in determining the hydrographical
character of the great Russian lowlands. And in fact,
the hydrographical influence of both mountains and plateaus
is so great, that it is worthy of careful and special
study.</p>

<p>The combinating and grouping of plateaus in different
continents give rise to great contrasts, observable most distinctly
in Asia and America.</p>

<p>Asia, with all its great internal depression from Cashgar
to Lake Lop, yet displays such immense districts of plateaus,
all ranges of elevation, low, moderate, and very
great, that the very grandeur and extent of its colossal
mountain chains are subordinate in comparison. Asia is
the land pre-eminently of plateaus.</p>

<p>America displays, not in its central but on its western
coast, the greatest chain of mountains on the globe, flanked
by plateaus of great elevation, but of superficial area
quite out of proportion to the length of the mountain
chain, and to the extent of the lowlands of both the
northern and the southern divisions. And while in
Africa the regions of depression are in the north, and in
Asia around the great central plateau system, in the Americas,
both North and South, they are thrown into the
eastern portion.</p>

<p>Australia, in perfect contrast again, is, with the exception<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
of its southeastern corner, a vast tract of unbroken
lowland. No diversity is possible there, no change in the
condition of life, but a ceaseless uniformity of monotonous
but prodigal gifts.</p>

<p>Is not the imposing grandeur of these harmonious, provisional
arrangements for the use of man calculated to fill
the soul with admiring wonder, and to lead us to suspect,
above all this display of cause and effect, above all this
working out of a manifestly preconceived plan, the existence
of a great and active Being, who has planned and
executed it all with higher ends and a loftier purpose than
to satisfy the mere earthly life of man?</p>

<h3 id="heading20">Primeval Formation of Plateaus and Mountains.</h3>

<p>To enter upon a discussion of the manner in which plateaus
and mountains were formed, would make it necessary
to resort to such judgments as we could draw from
their external appearance and their internal structure.
The rapid progress of geology does indeed afford us many
probabilities thoroughly grounded. A few of these may
have been briefly indicated in connection with some elevated
regions, where the massiveness is striking, and
where the axis of elevation is prolonged to a considerable
extent. In such cases the influence exerted on the world
is more evident than it could be elsewhere.</p>

<h3 id="heading21"><i>Origin of Plateaus.</i></h3>

<p>Alexander von Humboldt has employed the term Intumescence,
to indicate the manner in which plateaus have
been upheaved. Plateaus appear as long, often wide,
mostly level, sometimes rolling, sometimes hilly elevations,
presenting an appearance as if the earth had swelled with
confined gases, and with depressions here and there as if,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
in the casting of the molten mass within, a natural external
subsidence had followed. They have, therefore, viewed
in their internal structure, an unbroken wholeness, and are
free from those vast fissures which characterize mountains,
rending the earth for hundreds of feet down. The utmost
want of uniformity is seen in the gradual depressions
which often harbor the large internal lakes found in great
plateaus. Varied as they are in configuration, they always
retain marks enough to indicate that they owe their upheaval
to steady, gentle, and not tumultuous forces within,
exerted at the time of the primeval cooling of the earth’s
crust; in contrast, therefore, with mountains, which were
thrust up from beneath, through huge seams made by the
bursting through of pent-up vapor and gases. These elevations
of the earth’s crust, whether in the form of mountain
or plateau, must correspond, in order that the symmetry
of the globe may be preserved, to the depressions
found in lowlands and beneath the water of oceans and
seas.</p>

<p>It is observable that the great plateau upheaval of the
Old World has taken the shape of a belt, which runs in a
northeasterly direction along its whole southeastern shore,
crossing the equator at an angle of 45°, broken, however,
at some places, but never so much as to destroy the coherence
of the belt. The diagonal of the rhomboidal plateau
of eastern Asia, passing due northeast through the table-land
of Thibet, indicates the direction of the whole band
of highlands. This band drops toward the south in uniformly
steep declivities; while toward the north it falls
away with gradual steps of transition, reaching at length
the regions of the greatest depression—Libya, northern
Arabia, the Caspian, Siberia, and, at last, the low regions
around the north pole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>In this belt or chaplet of plateaus lie the high table-lands
of South and Northeast Africa, Abyssinia, South
Arabia, Persia, Beloochistan, North Deccan, Afghanistan,
Thibet, East Tangut, and eastern Gobi, in Mantchooria.</p>

<p>Correspondent with this immense plateau belt, in the
New World, is the great American chain, once a wholly
volcanic, and though differing so much in structure, direction,
and hydrographical influence, yet giving the globe a
wholeness, a unity in diversity, which is strikingly apparent.</p>

<h3 id="heading22"><i>The Origin of Mountains.</i></h3>

<p>The linear regions of elevations of the earth’s surface,
as we may term them, in contradistinction to the plateaus
which are characterized by breadth rather than by length,
have been projected in the form of mountain chains, as
has been already hinted, through huge fissures made by
the rending of the earth’s crust. The upheaval to fill the
seam has, in some cases, been all made at once; in others,
in a succession of periods. The uniform agreement of all
the geological strata or their diversity decides this point.
Sometimes the rocky strata are laid bare and easily investigated.
Often, however, the observer is obliged to
draw conclusions from a part to the whole. Yet in all
cases the mountain, in contradistinction to the adjacent
plateau, is the tract which has been thrust through the
crust. The frequent steep and lofty precipices show the
immensity of the internal force required to lift the mountains
from their places, while the lines of stratification indicate
the direction of upheaval. The rifting of a seam in
the earth’s crust was the first step in the formation of
mountains; the filling up of the seam by liquid matter,
the second step. The upheaval of Asia, from the Persian
plateau to Gobi, in a line 60° N. E., seems to be connected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
with the most ancient revolution which the earth’s
crust ever experienced. The mountains there are, therefore,
more modern in origin than the plateau on which
they stand. The direction of the chain, in all cases, seems
to have been dependent on the direction of the fissure in
the earth’s crust, which the mountain range afterward fills.
The breaking through the crust necessarily occurred when
the pressure beneath the surface was very great, or when a
moderate pressure was exerted beneath a thin crust, where
the resistance was slight.</p>

<p>The latter case seems to have been prevalent in most
plateau regions. Their own gradual upheaval probably
thinned the surface, and made it more liable to fracture.
This accounts for the fact that the greatest mountains of
the globe are found contiguous to plateaus. And the
broader the original seam in the crust was, the broader
the mountain range which rose to fill it, either at a single
upheaval, or in a series of convulsive throes projecting successive
masses of molten matter from below. In the latter
cases the strata thus formed lie on each other like the
leaves of a book, their constitution changing according as
the more advanced stages of melting in the vast internal
caldron throw out more metamorphosed rocks. These
later layers rose to a greater or less height on the sides
of the partially-formed mountain, according to their specific
gravity, their more or less fluid state, and their rapidity
of cooling, as we can now see by examining the
layers in their present permanent condition.</p>

<p>Thus far we can conjecture, with great security, taught
by the manifestly wild and fierce convulsions which once
threw up the mountains, since in them distortion is the
rule and regularity of structure the exception, and also
by the equally manifest quiet and sustained process of upheaval,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
when the plateaus were formed; their strata being
in a state of regularity and unbroken repose.</p>

<p>When the great vents produced by the outward pressure
of internal volcanic forces occurred beneath the sea, they
were filled up in the same manner as on the dry land, excepting
that the summits of the mountains emerge above
the surface in the form of isolated islands, or when there
was a chain or group of mountains upheaved, as an archipelago.
When there was no rifting of the surface, and
no forcing up of whole chains of peaks through a thinned
crust, the fierce action of the internal heat appears to have
necessitated the upheaval of solitary volcanoes here and
there, in some cases even rows of them, to give vent to
the pent-up steam and gases, and to convey away the
molten tide within. When such volcanic series rose in
parallel ranges, they lifted, or may have lifted up the whole
district between them, as if upon their shoulders, and so
formed the American type of plateaus, of less breadth and
greater length than the Asiatic, and in height corresponding
with the volcanic peaks which form their rim, and to
which they are probably indebted for the form of their
structure.</p>

<p>It needs hardly to be added to what has been said
above, that the general direction of existing mountain
chains depends upon the direction of the primitive seams
made in the earth’s surface by internal forces. The Ural
Mountains, the Scandinavian chain, the Alleghanies, the
Ghauts, run on meridian lines; others more or less transversely.</p>

<p>The various kinds of rock which have been thrown up in
mountains enlighten us as to the process and results of the
internal heat of the earth; the successive formations display
not only the various eruptions of molten matter, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
its discharge in new layers above what had been thrown
out before, but reveal the relative age of the various formations.
We have in a single chain sometimes a whole
volume of history, marking off the epochs of upheaval with
the most perfect legibility and exactness. Many crystallised
rocks result evidently from the gradual process of
cooling after the ancient exposure to the intense heat of
the inner portions of the earth—granite, porphyry, gneiss,
slates, and the so-called metamorphosed rocks. These
used to be considered the oldest formations, but the upheaval
theory treats them as the latest formed.</p>

<p>Most mountain chains have been uplifted to their present
height by a succession of upheavals. To accomplish
this has been labor of uncounted thousands of years. Only
a very few—the main Carpathian range, for instance—seem
to have been upheaved at a single convulsion, and to have assumed
their present appearance at once. Where there were
incessant eruptions accompanied with flames, and masses
of molten matter (lava) have been ejected from the crest
or from single summits, these volcanoes and volcanic
ranges have been the result. Elsewhere no such phenomena
have been visible. Possibly, in such cases, the
masses cooled so rapidly as to extinguish or fill up what
may have been embryo craters, and the plutonic acclivities
may have been repressed, leaving us the traces of primeval
eruptions, but no vestiges of any dangerous forces remaining
till now. Of mountains formed in this manner, may
be mentioned the Puys de Dome, the Bohemian basaltic
peaks, trachyte Transylvania Alps, the Katak Kaumene,
(“Burnt Tract,”) of Asia Minor, and Hauran, Iceland,
parts of the great American chain, parts of the Sunda
chain, the South Sea Islands, and Bagdoola, and its range
of extinct volcanoes in the Thian-Shan chain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>But other forces besides fire were competent to form
mountains and plateaus, to spread layers of clay and sand
and various deposits at the bottom of the sea, afterward
to harden into strata of rock. In contradistinction to plutonic
formations, these have been called neptunic, because
formed at the bottom of the sea. The oldest of the neptunic
or stratified rocks have been upheaved by the subterranean
forces, and now are found in the elevated
plateaus or mountain ranges, still having, however, their
unbroken irregularity of structure. Also, after the stratification
has been complete, and plutonic acclivities have
opened the seams in the earth of which I have already
spoken, and molten masses have rushed up to fill them,
fragments of the primitive stratified rocks have been
caught up and raised, together with the molten masses, to
the very summits of lofty mountains; so that the geologist
finds fossils there more or less perfectly preserved,
the stratified rocks which contain them surrounded by
the plutonic rock upheaved from below the surface. Chalk
layers full of mollusca and infusoria have been found by
Humboldt and von Buch on the very summits of the
Andes, and corresponding with those which have been
discovered by Ehrenburg in the deposits at the bottom
of the sea.</p>

<p>Other older and more recent oceanic deposits are found
in their primitive condition at the bottom of the sea, or in
very low places on the land. In such localities the surface
of the earth is composed of horizontal or slightly inclined
layers or strata, of secondary formation, and whose
origin in deposits from water cannot be denied. These
are the beds of chalk, clay, sand, marl, gypsum, and other
common substances; and these strata again have been
overlaid with more recent accumulations, the result of diluvium<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
or alluvium, continuing even up to the present
time.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<h3 id="heading23">Lowlands.</h3>

<p>This variety of the earth’s surface stands in the strongest
contrast with mountain regions, or, in one word, with the
highland form in all its modifications. The name lowland
we apply to all those broad tracts which do not rise more
than four hundred feet above the level of the sea. The
absolute elevation is determined from a section drawn
vertically from the superior surface to the plane of the
sea. Every comparison by numbers of one lowland plain
with its more elevated surroundings gives only a relative
result, as for instance, in comparing the valleys of one
chain of mountains with those of a more lofty chain. Such
relative lowlands may lie at a great elevation above the
sea, as the vale of Chamouni, for example, at the north
foot of Mont Blanc, is 3000 feet above the ocean level.
Both conceptions of the word lowland, which is common
to elevated plains as well as those at the sea’s margin,
are entirely different, and should be kept distinct, although
they are very often confounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>We are to deal here only with the absolute, great, and
generally diffused lowlands, in contrast with which the
elevated valleys and plains just referred to may be considered
as mountain table-lands and the rims of plateaus.</p>

<p>We assume, as we did in judging of the two grades of
plateaus, an arbitrary standard of measurement, and limit
the rise of real lowlands to an altitude of 500 feet above
the level of the sea. Great tracts of running plain, rising
by so slight a grade as to be almost imperceptible, can be
regarded only relatively as lowland, and, in a strict sense,
belong to those regions of transition which fall more truly
within the domain of highland or plateau. The word
plain indicates the opposite of hill or mountain, but has
nothing to do with the greater or less degree of absolute
elevation, although it is often used as if it had.</p>

<p>The lower limits of lowlands are sharply defined enough.
They are the margin of the sea, toward which the slope
usually becomes almost imperceptibly small. Often the
expression is used, yet not quite fitly, that the lowland
extends into the sea for some distance, and is found beneath
the surface. Strictly this is the bottom of the sea,
and does not fall under consideration in this connection.</p>

<p>Many lowland plains rise so slightly above the sea level,
that they are not unfrequently submerged, and, in many
cases, owe their existence to repeated overflows. They
are the basins of old gulfs, as in the very slightly elevated
plains of Caracas, whose whole shore is open to the influences
of the great Atlantic current flowing from east to
west; or, as in the great Lombardy plain, which slopes at
the same almost imperceptible degree toward the Adriatic.
There are also some lowlands found in the interior of continents,
and these, too, sinking below the level of the sea;
but they are altogether exceptional, and only met with in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
two or three instances. They are called, by an accommodation
of an algebraic term, <i>negative</i> lowlands. To them
belong the region around the Caspian and the Aral Seas,
and the much smaller tract comprising the Dead Sea, and
forming the Jordan valley; besides, there is the Suez
steppe, inclosing the bitter lakes between Asia and Africa;
and possibly the Beled-el-Jereed, in the western part of the
Sahara and the central part of Australia.</p>

<p>To these it might not be incorrect to join those partial
lowlands which have been rescued by human efforts from
the sea; the marshes, for instance, behind the dikes of
Holland, Sleswick, East Friesland, and at the mouths of
the Vistula, the Weser, the Nile, the Ganges, and other
rivers.</p>

<p>The most extensive lowlands in the world are probably
those which embrace Siberia, in Asia, and the Canadian
and polar region of North America. Many great tracts,
entirely inland, are in those flat districts covered by sea-water
which was once driven in by great storms, and now
lies stagnant, resulting in inapproachable swamps and morasses.
Yet, under the equator, there are immense lowlands,
as, for instance, in the eastern Sahara, although this
region is broken by strips of plateau, and is by no means
that uniform lowland plain which it used to be regarded.
Northern Australia belongs to the same category, and
also those immense plains which reach from the Atlantic
so far into the interior of Brazil, along the lower Amazon.
By the time, however, that they reach the middle course
of that river, they have acquired, though in such imperceptible
steps, a considerable degree of elevation, according
to Humboldt’s barometrical observations, and not reckoning
certain limestone hills found there, from 1050 to 1200 feet.
The plains of the middle Marañon are, therefore, true<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
plains, but not absolute lowlands, and not to be identified
with the great flat region at the mouth of the river, and
in comparison with the real lowlands of Venezuela, which
do not rise over 200 feet above the sea, and genuine plateau,
which, level as it is and broad as it is, is far more
elevated than the Valdai plateau, in Russia.</p>

<p>Almost all great river mouths are true lowlands—the
Egyptian delta, the delta of the Ganges and the Indus,
for instance, (the two latter being separated by the very
moderate plateau (100 feet) between Delhi and Mooltan;)
to these we may add the delta of the Euphrates, the east
shore of China, between the Blue and the Yellow Rivers,
and Senegambia, between the Senegal and the Gambia.
And in America, the same thing occurs in the Mississippi,
Orinoco, Amazon, and La Plata, where the immense
mass of water which they send to the sea passes through
lowlands of very great extent. In the Mississippi they
extend from the mouth as far north as the confluence
of the Missouri and the Mississippi, where stands St.
Louis, not 500 feet above the level of the sea. The
prairies west of the lower course of the river rise rapidly,
though imperceptibly to the eye, to the high terraces of
Kansas, at Council Grove, varying from 1500 to 2000
feet absolute elevation, and then more rapidly toward the
west, to mountain plains or plateaus, from 3000 to 6000
feet high. These, of course, lose the distinctive character
of lowland.</p>

<p>The mouth of the St. Lawrence is, in some respects,
analogous. Lowlands accompany it for a great distance
from the sea; at Lake Ontario the elevation is only 232
feet, at Lake Erie only 565 feet. Yet the level tract is
narrowed down to a mere border, and does not widen
into great lowland plains. The contracted region of low<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
country along the St. Lawrence is broken up, too, by rocky
heights and rib-like ledges, whose absolute height, however,
is not to be confounded with the elevation of the
plain which they traverse.</p>

<p>In entire contrast are the broad plains of South America,
which lie along the course of the Orinoco, La Plata,
and Amazon, the so-called pampas and savannas, which
extend a great distance into the interior, farther, indeed,
than investigators have yet thoroughly prosecuted their
researches. In no continent are the distinctions between
highland and lowland so sharply drawn as in America.
The lowland plains occupy four-fifths of all the country
east of the Andes, in South America: only one-fifth is
highland; for, notwithstanding the extent of low plateaus
and diminutive mountains scattered through these
great plains, yet their entire amount is inconsiderable,
compared with the immense lowland tracts of that continent.
America has fitly been called the region of the
greatest depression on the globe, because this is the prevailing
characteristic of its whole eastern side, lowlands
forming two-thirds of all America, and highlands
only one-third.</p>

<p>In Asia, the later hypsometrical observations have shown
that the lowlands are by no means so extensive as they
were formerly supposed. The highland extends, according
to von Middendorf, much farther northeast of the Yenisei,
toward the northern limit of Siberia and Tschatschi, than
was formerly supposed; and the Siberian plain extending
westward to the Ural Mountains is narrowed down
from 4,079,970 to 2,233,800 square miles. Yet this lowland
comprises, including central Bokhara or Toorkistan,
1,051,200 square miles, and other low Asiatic plains
1,314,000, the enormous area of 4,599,000, or more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
twice the extent of Europe, leaving 9,636,000 square miles
for the highlands.</p>

<p>In Africa there are almost no lowlands to speak of, excepting
the districts around the mouths of the great rivers
indicated a few pages back. To all equatorial Africa this
physical feature is entirely wanting. In the north, where
the whole Sahara was formerly thought to be one vast
low plain, there are now known to be the moderate plateaus
already indicated. The area of true lowland is,
therefore, sensibly diminished. Vogel’s barometrical observations
have already shown us that the country around
Lake Tchad is about 1200 feet above the sea; the surface
of Lake Tchad is 850 feet above the ocean level, and the
lower limit of that region does not, therefore, come within
the range already set as the point where lowlands become
highlands.</p>

<p>In Australia the lowland seems to be the prevailing
physical form, although here and there exceptions to it
occur.</p>

<p>In Europe there are three great lowland plains to be
specially mentioned. The greatest, that of middle Europe,
embraces the shores of the North Sea and the Baltic
far inland, and extend the farthest to the southeast. A
second, hardly of less extensive proportions, comprises all
northern Russia as far as the White Sea and the Arctic.
It embraces but one-third of the great polar plain, and is
really one with the region beyond the Ural chain. The
third is the region around the Black and Caspian Seas.</p>

<h3 id="heading24">The Middle European Lowlands.</h3>

<p>The Germanic-Sarmatia-Russian plain extends, without
a break, from the mouths of the Rhine, through all central
Europe, to the middle Volga and the Ural. It is pre-eminently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
a region of lowlands, without any elevations of importance,
and having no change of level, except very gently
undulating swells, and on the north and south margin
plateaus which very seldom rise over 500 feet. It begins
with the deltas of the Rhine and the Scheldt, in Holland,
passes through Lower Westphalia, Lower Saxony, the
Marks, Lower Silesia, Lower Gallicia, and Poland, as far
as the upper Dnieper and the middle Volga. It extends
up the Rhine as far as Strasbourg, 474 feet above the sea,
up the Weser as far as Cassel, 486 feet, and up the Elbe
as far as Dresden, 280 feet.</p>

<p>The true Rhine delta may be defined as lying between
Amsterdam, on the sea, and Dusseldorf, 107 feet above
the sea level. Then passing by the broken and romantic
tract lying between Dusseldorf or Cologne and Mayence,
we come to the true Rhenish lowland, 240 feet above the
sea. Munster is 400 feet above the ocean level. East
of the Weser is the Lüneburg Heath, which advances in
elevation, as we go toward the Elbe and the Havel, to 300
or 400 feet. Brunswick lies at an altitude of 200 feet;
Magdeburg, of 128 feet. The height gradually increases;
at Wittenburg it reaches 204 feet; at Dresden 280 feet,
where the Elbe issues from the highlands; and in Lower
Silesia we find Breslau, 375 feet above the sea, and its
observatory, standing on the hills around the city, at a
height of 453 feet, which seems to be the highest point in
the whole vast tract.</p>

<p>Between the Rhine delta and the now dry basin of Paderborn,
from the Ems to the Weser, Aller, and middle
Elbe, is the mountain tract of the Hartz, (with the
Brocken at the north, 3500 feet high,) running up as far
as 52½° N. lat. By this natural feature the breadth of the
great plain is considerably curtailed. As it is also more to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
the east of the Leipsic basin, from which the Mulde, Elbe,
and Elster flow, by the hill country of Lausatia and North
Silesia, with the Riesengeberge, (Giant Mountains,) 5000
feet high, which extends northward as far as 51° N. lat.</p>

<p>A third basin is in the Silesian, from which the Oder flows
toward the northwest, and enters the southern limits of
the great plain near Oppeln and Brieg. A third tract
of hill country lies on the east bank of the Oder, and extends
to the middle Vistula, the Tarnowitz Heights, in
Upper Silesia, about 1000 feet in altitude. The plateau
north of the Carpathian range, on which Cracow lies, is
669 feet above the sea; and the most northern hill group
of Kielce, between the Pilica and the Vistula, rises in the
Kreutzberg to a height of 1920 feet, and in St. Catherine
to 2000 feet.</p>

<p>The great lowland advances eastward, with always diminishing
breadth from north to south, over the extensive
plains of the middle Vistula, at Warsaw, 330 feet above
the sea; over the Lithuanian morasses of the Bug; over
the Sarmatian district of Minsk and Pinsk as far as Kiev,
on the middle Dnieper, at the southeast, and as far as
Orsha and Smolensk, at the northeast. Pinsk, in the
middle of this tract, lies about 400 feet above the sea.
The north side of the plain is bounded by the very moderate
plateau south of the Valdai hills, at Smolensk, 792
feet high; at Osmana, southeast of Minsk, 882 feet. On
the south side it is bounded by the equally moderate plateau
of Wolhynia and Podolia, whose absolute altitude is
yet undetermined, but which, at the source of the Bug, is
about 1000 feet.</p>

<p>This is the great Lithuan-Sarmatian plain, which, east
of the Dnieper, is transformed into the central Russian
lowland, at whose middle point is Moscow, whose exact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
elevation above the sea is between 300 and 400 feet; at
Kazan, on the Volga, the height above the ocean level is
but 270 feet, measuring from the highest point on the
banks. Southward, the plain reaches to Simbeersk, 181
feet in altitude. The maximum breadth of this whole
vast lowland tract is about 500 miles; the distance between
Smolensk and Kiev, and the distance from the central
point of the great Russian section to any sea, is between
500 and 600 miles.</p>

<h3 id="heading25">The Origin of the Great Central European Plain.</h3>

<p>The slight elevation of the lowland just described, rising
but very little above the sea level, bears, throughout the
most of its extent between the dunes of the north and the
hill chains of the south, the character of a formation
rescued from the domain of the sea within the very latest
geological periods. The almost unbroken uniformity of
the surface from the Scheldt to the Volga, about 2500
miles, confirms the character which its geological structure
indicates. The deposition of disconnected, superimposed
layers, running to a great depth, is exactly similar to that
which we know results from the action now going on at
the bottom of shallow seas. And in the great central
European plain there is no sharply-defined geological limit
met at the border of the North and the Baltic Seas. The
same features extend beneath the surface of both of those
seas. This whole lowland is, therefore, to be regarded as
an immense basin, now dry, but once the bottom of a great
sea,—an extension of the seas which now form a part of
its northern border. The old coasts are now seen far inland.
Wherever this coast-line changed its course, the
whole landscape now alters its appearance; and yet more
striking than the external view is the internal constitution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
of the soil. Masses of stone, standing out in full view,
reveal the inner structure of what lies concealed. And
these rocky projections are precisely analogous to the
jagged outlines of our present bold sea-shores. The land is
not cut up by inlets hollowed out by the action of waves and
currents to a considerable depth, yet traces of such movements,
and of the physical formations effected by them, are
found. Promontories and islands are now found in plateaus,
and hills encompassing dry basins. To the latter
belong the intervale of the Rhine, and the basins of Paderborn,
Leipsic, and Silesia. To the former belong the
hills and plateaus of Middle Germany; of the Westphalian
Mark, from Elberfeld to Dortmund, or, as might be
said, from the Ruhr to the Lippe; the Yeutoburg Forest
to the Weser; then the Weser Mountains, and the Hartz
to the middle Elbe; the Thuringian Forest and the Ertz
Mountains around the Leipsic basin to the upper Elbe;
the Lausatian Mountains and the Riesengeberge to the
Glatz Mountains, on the upper Oder; the Trebnitz Heights
of Silesia, and the lower plateaus of the Fore Carpathian
range, embracing Cracow as far as the hills of Kielce and
the confluence of the Sau with the Vistula. Along the
southern border of the ever-broadening plain are the plateaus
of Gallicia, about 1000 feet in height, of Wolhynia
and Podolia, and then less elevated plateaus, till we reach
the Dnieper.</p>

<p>The geological character of the border of the sea which
once covered what is now central Europe, is full of interest,
because from it can be deduced all that we can know
of the history of those great changes.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> But we must pass<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
over this, and only indicate the geographical configuration
of the dry basin as it exists now, and forms the great Germanic-Sarmatia-Russian
plain.</p>

<p>In the course of previous remarks on the lowest range
of plateaus, I have remarked, that along the south coast
of the Baltic the moderately elevated hill chains of Pomerania
and of Old Prussia separated the true coast
with its lowland from the great interior plain, forming a
barrier, averaging about 300 feet in height, with here and
there a form which runs hard upon the lower limit of plateaus
of the second class; at any rate, a transition from
between the lowland and the plateau.</p>

<p>It may here be remarked that the long, low chains, made
up mainly of loose sand and other mixed and uncombined
materials, and running along the southern border of that
long, low band which skirts the Baltic, seem to be dunes
once running along the shore of a sea which has now receded
many miles to the north. In the deep channels and old
inlets now dry, as for instance in the great break through
which the Vistula passes below Thorn, only loose breccia,
and no united layers of stone, appear. Yet this does not
seem to be the case everywhere, although in the Cis-Ural and
Baltic depressions dune-like ridges are to be found, some
of them rising to a height much greater than was formerly
suspected. These, it is true, are scattered, and only partially
prevalent, but here and there they ascend to an altitude
of nearly 1000 feet. At the eastern end of the great
Pomeranian sea-plain west of Dantzic, and between that
city and Bütow, where the sand ridge, which formed the
ancient shore-line, runs very far to the north, there are a
number of villages 400 feet above the sea. The Lower
Mountain, (Thurmberg,) 54° 13′ 29″ N. lat., rises to a
height of 1024 feet; the hill near Upper Buschkau, east<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
of the Thurmberg, is 814 feet high; the hill near Hulterfeld,
846 feet; and the Höckerberg, near Schönberg, 902
feet.</p>

<p>Of the Thurmberg, Humboldt remarks that it is the
most remarkable elevation between the Hartz and the
Ural Mountains, and that but a few points in the Valdai
range can be brought into comparison with it. Its position
close by the sea is especially noteworthy. It is very
probable, according to Humboldt’s opinion, that those inequalities
of surface, formed of sand once partly or wholly
submerged,—found in Mecklenberg, Pomerania, East
Prussia Proper,—and now divided into flats and hill
ranges, do not belong to the dune system of the ancient
shore-line, but have the reason of their existence in ordinary
upheaval; in the formation of limestone, and of the
usual Jurassic rocks, which, afterward, have been covered
with sand and other loose materials. The peculiar accumulation
of genuine marine fossils indicates the existence of
upheaved rocks below the upper layer of sand.</p>

<p>It is these elevations which in the constantly advancing
ridge or ridges run northeasterly, and take the form of
plateaus, increasing in breadth from the water-shed north
of Smolensk, and the source of the Dnieper, in the Valdai
Forest, and the western Uwalli, and which are found between
the Volga and the Dwiner, and thence run eastward
as far as Perm, on the Kama. They form the line of demarkation
between the great Central European plain and
the North Russian lowland, which extends as far up as
the Arctic. This easterly chain, so far as it has been
measured, seems to be less in altitude than the Valdai
hills, which are about 1000 feet high. In East Prussia
Proper and Livonia there are elevations of more than 600
feet; about 55 miles south of Dorpat Munnamäggi, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
point of culmination, according to Struve, is 996 feet
above the sea; south of Vilna the heights of Puzewitch
reach an elevation of 990 feet.</p>

<p>In the same direction, still northeast, runs the Valdai,
forming the source of a number of large streams and the
great water-shed of eastern Europe. On the road from
St. Petersburg to Moscow, Humboldt found the altitude
at Norwaja Ijetza 660 feet, and the highest point at
Popowa Gora 792 feet, (according to Pausner, 876 feet.)
One point going south from the Valdai, at Mosti Derewna,
the latter naturalist has ascertained to be 1032 feet above
the sea; and the highest point in the range is, according
to Helmersen, 1098 feet. Still further eastward, between
the Valdai hills and the lake region between Lake Seligher
and Bielo Ozero, the range of uplands, known as Uwalli,
running northwesterly, intersected by numerous canals, and
forming the water-shed of a number of rivers, gradually
diminishes in height, but, still advancing eastward, it rises
again, in the neighborhood of Perm and the Kama, to 1014
feet,—about the elevation of the Valdai range. Uwalli
is only the Sclavic name of such hills as those whose
absolute height is insignificant, but which, crossing as
they do the great plains of Poland, Lithuania, and Russia,
were formerly confounded with mountain ranges, and were
so represented on the maps. They have, of course, great
hydrographical value, and play a leading part as the water-shed
of eastern Europe.</p>

<h3 id="heading26">The Ponto-Caspian Plain, the Great Depression of the
Old World.</h3>

<p>This second vast lowland is the direct continuation of
the central European lowland, with a decided sinking toward
the Black and the Caspian Seas, indicated by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
course of the rivers of that region. It extends from the
month of the Danube over the lower Dniester, Bog,
Dnieper, Don, and Volga, as far eastward as the Sea of
Aral. To the last named the Siberian plain gradually
declines. The southern plain of Europe stands in unbroken
connection, so far as its formation is concerned,
with the West Siberian plain, (2,213,400 square miles in
extent,) and is, therefore, one of the most extensive lowlands
on the globe. The Baltic-Sarmatian plain is separated
from the West Siberian merely by the long Ural
chain, (from 50° to 67° N. lat.,) whose elevation is only
from 4000 to 5000 feet, and whose breadth is unimportant.
Take away the Ural, and a continuous line could be
drawn from Breda, near the confluence of the Meuse,
Rhine, and Scheldt, across Europe and Asia, following the
line of 50° N. lat as far as the Chinese frontier, passing
over a continuous series of low, insignificant hills, heathlands,
and steppes, and traversing a space estimated by
Humboldt to be three times the length of the Amazon!</p>

<p>Toward the south, the Cis-Ural, European side of the
Ponto-Caspian lowland, is separated from the Black Sea
by a ridge of granite knolls, which passes from Volhynia
and Podolia eastward as far as the cataracts of the
Dnieper, and thence southeast, with diminished breadth,
reaching its limit at Taganrog, on the lower Don, and the
Sea of Azof. This ridge separates the narrow steppes
of the northern shore of the Black Sea from the lowland
of South Russia, the fruitful district of Ukraine. The
height of these hills in the west, where they appear to
have the greatest elevation, has been estimated to be
about 1000 feet above the sea. Toward the Dnieper they
have not yet been carefully measured; but probably there
they do not rise above 700 feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>The small sand steppe south of these granite hills runs
from the Crimea eastward as far as the North Caucasian
steppe, between the Don, Volga, and the Caspian, and
indeed may be traced to the northeast as far as the Bashkiric-Ural
chain. Lakes of marked saltness are found
there: Elton, for instance, which lies 24 feet above the
sea; while farther eastward they are found, as for example
on the Kamysh and at Samara at a depression of—138
feet, 60 feet below the level of the Caspian Sea.
Yet this lacks confirmation.</p>

<p>From this lowland, only a few elevations arise, and
these of insignificant absolute height; yet, on account of
the extreme uniformity of the whole country, they are objects
of amazement to the whole steppe world. The
Little Bogdo, south of Lake Elton, and yet farther south,
Great Bogdo, 504 feet above the sea, according to Humboldt,
and Mount Arsargar, 331 feet in absolute height,
according to Murchison, are the only important hills.
The Great Bogdo is composed of calcareous limestone
and of sandstone, with rich deposits of salt.</p>

<p>The Kirgheez steppe separates, by a plain of very moderate
elevation, the north Siberian lowland from the Caspian-Ural
depression. It was formerly supposed, and indeed
represented on the map, that a mountain range
passes through this district from the Ural chain to the
Altai. The Kirgheez steppe appears to range from 780 to
960 feet in elevation; while the Siberian plain is but 280
feet above the sea at Omsk, 192 feet at Tora, and 108 feet
at Tobolsk. It has been considered by some that the
Kirgheez steppe, as well as the granite hills of southern
Russia, belong to an undeveloped system of mountains,
an early cooling having solidified them before reaching the
elevation which they would have attained; and that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
partake of the direction which analogy would teach us
such a chain would have, from northeast to southwest,
parallel with the Carpathian and the Caucasus ranges.</p>

<p>The great depression of the Old World begins with the
deepening of the Volga basin below Simbeersk; and at the
place (51¾° N. lat., near Orenboorg and Saratov) where it
breaks through the last row of hills in the Obstshei-Syrtis,
it commences a rapid descent toward the Caspian and
the Aral Seas. This great concavity, on the confines of
Europe and Asia, at the center of the greatest land-mass,
and far removed from any ocean, is remarkable as having
no parallel on the globe. Humboldt remarks that perhaps
a similar phenomenon would be repeated at the interior
of other continents, if the tertiary formation and the
parts found by marine deposit did not exist. It would be
profitable to follow out so weighty a thought, with the surface
as it now is.</p>

<p>The Obstshei-Syrtis is the moderate range of hills which
runs westward in two branches from the Bashkiric-Ural,
at Orenboorg, the northern spur running by Uralsk and the
Ural River; the southern by Samara, rising on the east
shore of the Volga to a height of 600 feet, and ending at
Sarepta.</p>

<p>Orenboorg, on the Obstshei-Syrtis, where it leaves the
Ural chain, is 255 feet above the sea. Uralsk lies somewhat
lower, being 234 feet above the sea. The surface
of the Volga, where it breaks through the high banks of
Saratov, is only 36 feet above the ocean level; while the
western shore, above Saratov, is 562 feet in height. Farther
down the river, Sarepta lies 30 feet below the sea
level; and there is, therefore, between Saratov and Sarepta,
a distance of about 180 miles, a fall of 66 feet. West of
the Volga, and following the river, is the continuation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
the Obstshei-Syrtis, ranging in elevation from 562 feet
down to 168 feet. At Sarepta, the low hills which thus
far have skirted the Volga turn to the southwest, to the
Manitsh steppe, sinking to an elevation of but 75 feet, and
extending as far as the Sea of Azof. At Sarepta, too, the
Volga turns from its normal southerly course, and strikes
southeasterly across the Astracan steppe, entering the
Caspian at the City of Astracan, 72 feet below the level
of the sea. The level of the sea is 4 feet below the shore
on which Astracan is built.</p>

<p>The old statements that the level of the Caspian is 300
feet below the ocean, rested solely on conjectures made by
the naturalist Pallas. The influence of this great depression
on the warmer climate of that region, the peculiar
vegetation of the salt steppes, and the salt morasses which
exist where the land is perfectly level, as well as the great
beds of oyster-shells and other crustaceous remains, led
him to the hypothesis that the whole neighboring district
is the dry and deserted bed of a former sea, now shrunk
to the comparatively insignificant dimensions of the Caspian.
The broken line of bold bluffs which bounds the
Obstshei-Syrtis on the south seemed to him to be the
northern boundary of this inland sea, into which the Volga
entered below the pass of Kamyschin and Saratov. Parrot
and Engelhardt supposed that their barometrical elevations
in 1811 confirmed Pallas’ theory, that the Caspian
lies 300 feet below the ocean. Many hypotheses were based
upon their observations; but the whole were at length
brought into discredit by Humboldt, who distrusted the
accuracy of instruments made at that time. Nothing but
a trigonometrical survey from Taganrog to Astracan could
give conclusive results, and this was accomplished in 1837,
under the auspices of the Russian government. The result<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
proved that, so far from being 300 or 350 feet below
the ocean, the Caspian is not 100 feet. Its depression, as
already stated, is about 76 feet.</p>

<p>The level of the Aral Sea, which is evidently closely
linked to the Caspian, has not yet been determined with
absolute certainty. Barometrical observations were instituted
for this end by the expedition under General Berg,
which explored that region in the winter of 1826, but the
cold was severe, and the results are questionable. The
result of their investigations was, however, that the surface
of the Aral lies 110 feet higher than that of the
Caspian. This would make the Aral to be 34 feet above
the sea level. More careful inquiries may, however, determine
the level of the two seas to be the same; but at
present we have to be content with the results of the expedition
referred to, and accept its elevation as 34 feet
above the level of the ocean.</p>

<p>Without, however, going into details respecting the
Aral, the region around the Caspian and directly connected
with it, which is below the ocean level, embraces
an area of not less than 131,400 square miles. This survey
extends from the Volga to the Ural River, thence to
the Emba and the northernmost point of the Sea of Aral,
and thence to the salt lakes of Aksakal-Barbi, lying to the
northeast of this sea. The tracing of this line from the
higher to the lower stages of depression gives clear indications,
in the nature of the soil, of the existence of a great
sea once occupying that whole tract.</p>

<p>Thus much for the configuration of the Caspian lowland.
If to these 131,400 square miles be added the
153,000, or, according to Humboldt, 164,000 square miles
of the Caspian itself, the entire depression embraces almost
318,000 square miles, and is greater than France,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
greater than Germany, and only to be compared with the
whole Austrian empire! If to this great region be added
the district around the Aral, which sea alone covers nearly
25,000 square miles, and then to this the yet unmeasured
surface covered by seas yet to the eastward, the entire region
of depression is immensely increased. And then if
to this be added the great Siberian plain, whose level is
not greatly above the sea, the combined district would be
at least once and a half as great as all Europe.</p>

<h3 id="heading27">The Origin of the Ponto-Caspian Depression.</h3>

<p>Thinking of the immense extent of this depressed region,
whose entire surface occupies no inconsiderable fraction
of the interior of the Old World, and whose greatest
depth at the bottom of the Caspian is from 500 to 600
feet below the level of the ocean, and looking at it as a
phenomenon wholly unique, the question arises: How
would such a condition be possible, contradicting, as it
seems, all analogies? The answer, could we reach it,
would not fail to illustrate many recondite geological
questions, and to be full of instruction.</p>

<p>Yet the time has not come when a full answer can be
given to this inquiry. We have not yet learned the elementary
conditions of this remarkable fact; there are innumerable
investigations yet to be made, before we can
feel perfectly certain that its reason is understood. Still,
there have been some preparatory inquiries entered upon,
and some preliminary steps taken toward reaching a conclusion,
or, at least, toward assuming a reasonable hypothesis.
We have already indicated our belief that this
depression is connected with a ring of plateaus which have
been upheaved around it, and which now inclose it and
isolate it from the ocean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>The hollow has its greatest depth near the southern extremity
of the Caspian, where it rises abruptly to the Persian
plateau. There pass, in the form of a half circle, the
loftiest mountains and plateaus of central Asia. On the
west side the Caucasus rises, with its giant peaks of Kasbek
and Elbrooz, 15,000 to 17,000 feet high, bearing all
the marks of volcanic origin,—avalanches of solidified lava
on the sides, a lake lying in the abyss of an extinct crater,
and the like.</p>

<p>At the southwest, the Armenian plateau follows the
course of the Aras from its mouth back to the huge dome
of Ararat, 14,656 feet high. The entire geological appearance
of that region—the old lava streams, the trachyte
rocks—indicate with equal clearness, as in the Caucasus,
the agency of volcanic forces in the upheaval of that
district. Traces of this great power are also seen in the
caldron-shaped hollows, and in the narrow and deep defiles,
which are abundant in that region.</p>

<p>South of the Caspian, which in its southern part reaches
a depth ranging as low as 420, 480, and 600 feet, and, according
to Hanway, even 2700 feet, rise sharply from the
sea the Persian Coast Mountains. The plateau of Teheran,
3400 feet in elevation, is directly beyond, from
which rise the volcanic peaks of Demavend, 20,000 feet,
and Euczan, 6600 feet high. The Coast chain embraces
the Elboorz Mountains, uniformly more than 5000 feet high,
but which, at Schemrum, northwest of Teheran, rise to a
height of 8560 feet; at Churchurah, southwest of Demavend,
to 7650 feet; at Nevo, southeast of Demavend, to
8540 feet; at Nejoster, in the Seriakush, east of Demavend,
to 7200 feet; and which, above Asterabad, rise in
the Shahkush and the Sundukkush to a height of 7270
feet, and almost everywhere display in their trachyte rocks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
the traces of ancient volcanic activity. Still farther to the
east, the chain which has girdled the Caspian sinks from
the lofty height of the Northern Taurus to 1872 feet; in
Meshed, 2628 feet; in Herat, an average elevation of
3400 to 4000 feet. But east of Herat it rises abruptly to
the lofty plateaus of Bamian and Cabool, 7000 and 8000
feet high, and in the peaks of Colubeba 16,800 feet. The
Hindoo Koosh, at Dsellalabad, rises to a height of 18,984
feet; the table-lands of the Bolor, at the Issikul, are at an
elevation of 14,664 feet; while the gigantic Pameer is not
yet measured, though its noted Pass is estimated at 18,000
feet above the sea.</p>

<p>At this point we reach almost the 40th degree of N. lat.,
whence northward the mountain ranges gradually decline
in height, after throwing off eastward the great chain of
Thian-Shan. From the sharp angle formed by the Hindoo
Koosh and the Bolor, where the head-waters of the Gihon
rise, that large but commercially unimportant river takes
its way westward through the Bokharan table-land, falling
so rapidly in its course to Bokhara that at the city its
surface is but 1116 feet above the sea, then striking northwesterly
to the Aral and Caspian. The course of that
stream indicates, therefore, the direction and degree of
the mountain slope toward the great depression east of
the Caucasus and Armenia, north of the Persian highland,
and west of the Hindoo Koosh and the Bolor systems.</p>

<p>The lower course of the Gihon, from Bokhara downward,
is through masses of mud, sand, and gravel, and
can very easily be conceived to have changed its course in
the lapse of centuries, from the Caspian to the Aral, as
the course of the Sihon seems also to have changed. The
great Bokharan plain is covered in this part with a deposit
of dried mud; it is a steppe formed evidently from a now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
dry sea-basin, which, no less than the northern shores of
the Caspian and the Aral, displays the traces of the oceanic
character of entire regions.</p>

<p>Halley, the astronomer, made an attempt to solve the
mysterious origin of this great sunken basin, and attributed
it to the stroke of a first-class comet! Arago, instead
of calling into the scene meteorological forces little known,
contented himself, in his theory of its origin, with the
forces which we know are active even now on the earth,
the plutonic powers which are only half confined by the
surface of the globe. No one, he says, will hesitate now
to accept the upheaval theory, through which geology is
able so clearly to indicate the forces and progress of structure
of the soil and rocks. The upheaval of great masses
in one place predisposes the depression of districts in their
neighborhood, to make good the true relation of highland
to lowland. And in this case a compensation may be
found, according to Arago, for the great semicircle of
mountains which passes around the southern margin of
the Caspian basin, in the depression caused by the natural
falling in of the adjacent region when the great mountains
of western Asia were upheaved.</p>

<p>In longitudinal mountain chains the parallel ranges of
valleys have a similar origin; in volcanic chains, which
have been thrown up in a circular form, similar depressions
have been found in the middle, although, it must
be confessed, on a much smaller scale of dimensions than
in the Caspian hollow. The same feature is observable
in the upheavals, by Von Buch, as observed in the Island
of Palma, one of the Canaries, or in the Val di Bove, near
Etna. Such depressions would at once fill with water, if
connected with the sea, as in the cup-shaped island Santorini,
or remain land-locked, if they occur in the interior,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
as in the case of Lake Laach, as the half-ring of mountains
girding the lower portion of the Caspian seems to
consist mainly of trachyte thrown up by volcanic agency:
the analogy just drawn does not seem too remote. Yet
the process of structure must have had other concomitant
conditions to account for the vast reach northward of the
Caspian depression. It is clear that any such volcanic
convulsion as would throw up those vast mountain ranges
at the south, must have affected largely the geological condition
of all the adjacent region; the extent vertically of
this effect would be best ascertained perhaps by deep
boring. Unquestionably there was many a revolution in
the upper portions of the earth’s crust during the formation
of the great Caspian hollow, before it assumed its
present condition. From the agencies at work in connection
with a great internal ocean, the upper soil, as we have
it to-day, was formed.</p>

<p>The Aral and the Caspian Seas remain as the lowest
places of that great depression, water being found in them,
while elsewhere it has entirely disappeared by evaporation:
leaving us broad, low plains, instead of that great ocean
which once extended from Persia over all Siberia, and west of
the Caspian to the Sea of Azof. A more thorough account,
geographical as well as geological, cannot be given till
after much more extended investigations have been made
into the physical characteristics of this region than as yet
have been prosecuted. It may be remarked here, that the
waters of the Aral and Caspian are bitter and salt, but
not so much as those of the ocean; the bottom is covered
with slime and sand. The Aral has a depth ranging from
90 to 222 feet; the Caspian, beginning with its extensive,
shallows at the north, deepens toward the south, till,
reaching the lower third, its depth is over 600 feet;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
and thence southward it is no less deep, till it reaches the
bold shore of Eusellis. From this lowest point the upheaval
begins, which culminates in the great mountains
on its southern border.</p>

<p>According to Humboldt’s view, the great Caspian hollow
embraces not only the basin of the sea, but a vast dry
plain, extending northward as far as Saratov and the Obstshei-Syrtis;
even Uralsk lies lower than the level of the
Black Sea. The same physical feature, though on a less
extended scale than here, is found in Holland, China,
Lower Egypt, and Palestine. Subsequently to the emergence
of the continents, long before the filling in of huge
fissures by mountain chains, and during the continuance
of those great convulsions which reach back into the remotest
geological periods, the surface of the continents
must have been subjected to frequent partial changes of
level. The surface undulated probably in that same wave
movement which is now observable, though in much less
degree, in those earthquakes and upheavals which the
whole western part of South America is experiencing
even now.</p>

<p>The depressions which have assumed a permanent form
since the convulsions which formed them, have gradually
filled with deposited soil, and, were the naturalist able to
lay bare the primitive rock, he would discover that it exists
in the shape of great concavities, without a trace of
that evenness which now characterizes the surface. Eichwald
has made it probable, by his personal observations,
that the upheaval of Ararat and of the Armenian plateau
on which this trachyte mountain rests, has driven the
Caspian Sea back east of the flat steppe of Karabagh and
Mogan, on the lower Aras, to the neighborhood of Bakoo.
The water of that sea formerly extended to the confluence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
of the Bargashad, (called also Bergershat and Bergernet,)
with the Aras, below Ireben. The traces of volcanic action
there are decisively evident: the Caspian reached, before
that action occurred, up what is now the valley of the
Aras, as far as Ararat; and in many places south of
Erivan—at Saliyan, in Shirwan, and elsewhere—salt beds
of the most crystalline quality, forming whole mountains
and whole belts of salt lakes at the confluence of the Aras
and the Koor, demonstrate their formation in a former sea
which once covered that region. The very recent upheaval
of the Ural chain cannot fail also to have had an
influence in contracting the dimensions of the Caspian
hollow.</p>

<p>Only two kindred depressions to this remain to be
spoken of, which, though of not so great superficial dimensions,
are of yet greater depth—the depression of the
Jordan Valley and the bitter salt lakes on the Isthmus of
Suez. These we must consider before we pass from
the contrasts between highlands and lowlands to the
transitions between them.</p>

<h3 id="heading28">The Depression of the Jordan Valley and of the
Dead Sea.</h3>

<p>The nearest relationship to the Caspian hollow, displayed
by any similar feature, is found near the heart of
the Old World, in the comparatively diminutive and isolated
valley of the Jordan, including the Dead Sea, whose
absolute depth below the level of the ocean has been determined
only within the most recent period. Many
former travelers had noticed, in the deep gulf which holds
the Dead Sea, and especially at its north end, near Jericho,
a much greater degree of heat than elsewhere in Palestine,
and the existence of many plants and fruits which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
they had met in the hotter climates of Arabia and India.
The tree which yields the Mecca balsam flourishes in the
oasis of Jericho; the product of the balsam of Palestine
supplied the pin-money of Cleopatra. A number of German
and English observers endeavored to solve the question
of the depth of the Jordan basin—von Schubert,
Russeger, von Wildenbruch, Moore, and Bake, later Symonds,
and Lynch; de Berton and Russeger made the
first barometrical observations at the Dead Sea, but they
did not attempt to give more definite limits to their results
than to assert that its surface is somewhere between 500
and 1100 feet beneath the ocean level.</p>

<p>Von Shubert’s barometer did not suffice to determine
this point, but he ascertained the surface of Lake Tiberias
to be 535 feet below the surface of the Mediterranean.
All barometrical measurements were unreliable at that
depth; yet it could not be denied that the depression could
not be an insignificant one. A measurement with the
level made by Symonds, an Englishman, from Jaffa to the
Dead Sea, in 1843, gave us our first sure results. The
surface of the lake lies 1231 feet beneath the level of the
Mediterranean at Jaffa. The subsequent expedition of
the Americans—Lynch, Dale, and Anderson, in 1848—has
given the following additional results:—</p>

<p>Soundings of the Dead Sea, made with the greatest
care, determined the depth to be, according to Lynch,
1227 feet; according to Symonds, 1970 feet. The entire
depression below the ocean level would be, then, by
Lynch’s measurement, 1235 + 1227 = 2462 feet; according
to Symonds’, 1235 + 1970 = 3205 feet. This is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
greatest known depression on the globe. Jerusalem lies
2449 feet above the ocean level. From the roofs of the
city to the surface of the Dead Sea is, therefore, 2449 +
1235 = 3684 feet; and the entire descent from the capital
to the bottom of the Dead Sea is 4911 feet, if we adopt
Lynch’s measurement, and 5654, if we follow Symonds’.</p>

<p>The basin of the Dead Sea consists of two very different
parts—the larger and deeper northern one, the smaller
and shallow southern one; the two being separated by a
sandy peninsula—el Mesraa—and connected by a narrow
channel of insignificant depth. The northern basin seems
to owe its present form to the unchanged primitive depression;
the southern one to a partial upheaval at some
later epoch. But in breadth they do not vary much one
from the other; both have their larger axis coincident with
the Jordan valley, which here widens a little, but which
is still hemmed in here, as farther north, by the parallel
ranges of mountains. The chain east of the sea appears
to rise a thousand feet higher than the one west of it.
The depths of the two basins are entirely unlike. The
southern is nowhere more than 12 feet deep, and diminishes
to 5 feet and less than this near the shores, so
that the southern half of it is entirely unnavigable by craft
of any size; and those who wish to land have to wade
for a long distance through mud as deep as their ankles.
The northern part, on the contrary, attains a uniform
depth of more than 1000 feet, from the north to the south;
in the northern third it is even 1227 feet; toward the west
coast it shoals to between 600 and 800 feet, but is 500 feet
deep hard-by the coast. There is but a very narrow rim
of shallow water on the western side, and the navigation
is, therefore, tolerably safe. On the eastern shore the coast
is even bolder, and the descent to deep water immediate.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
Close by the romantic mouth of the Arnon, embouching
through rocks, the depth of the sea is about 1052 feet. So
great a difference in the depth of the two basins seems to
indicate a considerable diversity in the manner of their
formation.</p>

<p>Volcanic activities have been felt in the Jordan
valley up to the present time. They manifest themselves
in various forms—deposits of salt, hot springs and naphtha
springs, asphaltum beds, sulphur fumes, currents of heated
air, clouds of smoke, and rumblings beneath the surface.
The Jordan valley remained, from Lake Tiberias down,
unfilled, as we should infer from analogy that it would be
by the upheaval of a chain of volcanic mountains; or by
the expansion of an internal lake or sea, the waters accumulating
till at last they should acquire such volume as
to break away and form new channels. In case the obstructions
were too great, they would remain inland lakes.
And such is the Dead Sea, its southern border being too
high to allow it a free exit into the Red Sea.</p>

<p>Many other fissures or hollows on the surface of the
continents would be regarded as lowlands, were they not
filled with water. The bottoms of such lakes often sink
suddenly to a great depth, while others are lagoon-like, or
shallow seas of an entirely different hydrographical character.
Internal lakes, regarded as isolated lowlands, merely
filled with water, are an especially interesting theme of
study; yet much remains to be investigated regarding
their structure and historical formation. The Dead Sea
has been regarded, up to this time, as the deepest of all
such lakes. The greatest depth of the Caspian has not
yet been fully ascertained; but if Hanway’s soundings,
2700 feet, are to be relied on, it is very great. Lake Baikal,
in its deepest part, between the two steep walls of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
rock which rise high above the surface, has not yet been
carefully sounded; but as its surface is 1500 feet above
the sea, its bottom does not probably fall below the ocean
level. The great chain of North American lakes, whose area
embraces about 109,500 square miles, are surrounded by
level country from 500 to 600 feet above the sea—a region
which, in part, falls under the designation of plateaus of
the lowest class, and which, in part, comes under the name
of lowland; the surface of Lake Superior being 627 feet
above the sea, Lakes Michigan and Huron 578 feet each,
Lake Erie 565 feet, and Lake Ontario 232 feet. The
three first named, having a depth of about 900 feet, have
their beds about 300 feet below the surface of the ocean;
Lake Ontario, with a depth of 500 feet, reaches a point
268 feet below the sea level. The depth of the St. Lawrence
river bed, as related to the sea, is not ascertained.
The most of the Swiss lakes, too, having a depth often of
more than 1000 feet, come under the same category with
the lakes under consideration above, waters from the
mountains having gradually filled up chasms made at the
time of the upheaval of the adjacent region. Some of
these lake basins may be deep enough to lie below the
level of the ocean.</p>

<h3 id="heading29">The Bitter Lakes of the Suez Isthmus.</h3>

<p>Some bitter salt lakes on the Isthmus of Suez, forming
a chain from the Red Sea to the southeast corner of the
Mediterranean, long claimed attention from their supposed
singularity. During the occupation of Egypt by the
French in 1799, a survey of the district was made with
the level, in view of a prospective canal across the isthmus,
connecting the Nile with the Red Sea. An account
of that survey was published by Le Père, in his great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
Description de l’Egypte. The result of the survey was
very surprising; it assigned to the Gulf of Suez a height
of 25 feet at ebb tide and 30½ feet at flood tide, above the
level of the Mediterranean, a result which seemed to agree
with Pliny’s account (vi. 23) of the elevation of the Red
Sea above the level of lower Egypt. The salt swamps
lying between the two seas, and known even to the ancients,
lie, according to the same authority, 20 feet below
the surface of the Mediterranean, and 50 feet below that
of the Red Sea. These singular statements were not received
without considerable doubt as to their correctness;
but during the military disturbances in that region, no revision
of the investigations could be made. Certain circumstances
connected with an unusual inundation of the
Nile in 1800, when its waters flowed as far as the transverse
valley called the Wady Tumilet, in which the salt
lakes lie, and where traces of the ancient canal, built by
the Egyptians between the seas, could be seen, seemed to
confirm the result of the survey of 1799. The inference
was a natural one—that the sandy Isthmus of Suez was
an accumulation of dunes, and of the deposits of inundations
of both the Mediterranean and Red Seas, and that
the salt morasses in the middle are but a trace of the
primitive bottom. There were not wanting defenders of
the old measurement, Favier being the most prominent.
Since 1845 five surveys have been made, in reference to
the projected canal. These all contradict the results of
1799, and show that there is but the difference of four-sevenths
of a foot between the level of the two seas, and
that there is the same agreement there as in all other
parts of the earth. Many hypotheses, built on the old
measurement, have accordingly fallen to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<h3 id="heading30">The Regions of Transition between Highlands and
Lowlands; the River Systems of the Globe.</h3>

<p>Between the two great and most sharply-marked physical
features—the high plateaus and mountains and the
lands of very little elevation—there are regions of transition
very numerous and exceedingly varied.</p>

<p>The conception of highlands and of lowlands having a
certain, constant, and absolute value, and it being immaterial
whether the elevation be specially marked or not,
provided it be uniform, the regions of transition find their
most marked characteristics in their want of constancy,
in their very change, and the rate at which the grade
ascends from a low to a high elevation, or falls from a
high to a low one. Their real value lies in the mutual
compensation of highlands and lowlands, which is effected
through the mediation of a third physical feature or system,
which has received the name Lands of Gradation, or
Terrace Lands, and which, by their gradual rise from the
sea level, serve as the means of transition from the lowest
lowlands to the loftiest plateaus and mountains.</p>

<h3 id="heading31">Terrace Lands and Rivers in their General Character.</h3>

<p>Districts sloping to the sea, or lands of gradation, as we
have called them, varying as they do in elevation and in
relative situation to each other, are the true mediators between
the districts but little above the level of the sea
and others much more lofty. At the sources and the
mouths of rivers they partake, more or less fully, in the
characteristics of both highland and lowland. The manner
of their mediation, as determined by the rate of the fall
of water and by their direction, gives to every one of these
regions of transition its peculiar character, determines its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
conformation and its relation to the globe. And yet, no
more than in lowlands and highlands, can we rid ourselves
of some arbitrary data relating to the size of rivers, when
we discriminate between those which we call large and
those which we call small. As in all other geographical
distinctions, we must here be content with arbitrary approximation,
and with the ordinary usages of speech.
The comparison of streams, in regard to their breadth
and fullness, determines their volume; the comparison, in
respect of length and tributary waters, determines the
compass of the river system. The entire characteristics,
breadth, depth of channel, length and extent of drainage,
determine the status of the river, whether first, second, or
third class, in relation first to those of the same continent,
and then to those of the world. The Volga, for instance,
is, in relation to Europe, a first-class river, but, like the
Danube, in relation to the entire globe, is merely in the
second or third rank. Not the length alone determines
the importance of rivers. The Thames, one of the smallest
streams in Europe, is one of the most important. And
aside from commercial considerations, a river of insignificant
size can have great influence in consequence of its relation
to the entire adjacent region. The little Bavarian Isar, a
river which, so far as the great world is concerned, seems
to have no importance, receives on the left side the water
of 860 tributary brooks, among which are 44 rivulets; on
the right bank the water of 433: these 1293 brooks and
rivulets pour themselves into the Isar through 103 direct
tributaries, and not these alone, but the waters of 136
lakes are embraced within the Isar system! Yet the
Isar is only one of 34 branches of the Danube, and of the
fourth rank even among them, and the Danube is by no
means one of the great rivers of the globe. A short but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
navigable stream can have great influence over a territory
limited in extent, and may make a long but shallow stream
sink into insignificance in respect of comparative importance
to the world. There are some great streams which are
of first magnitude in all their characteristics—rivers which
drain millions of square miles in their course to the sea.
The number of such is small, however; there are scarcely
fifty on the whole globe. Besides these, there is a large
number of rivers much shorter, and of much less volume,
but not deficient in the attributes which give a stream
value to man, and which serve to mediate between highlands
and lowlands, to fulfill the needs of navigation and
to drain regions of more or less magnitude. These can
be classed in four ranks: in the first place absolutely, and
in the second place in relation to each continent. Yet, in
classing them, it is necessary always to keep in mind that
it is not size alone which gives a river its value, but a
combination of all its characteristics, and its relative influence
on the country through which it runs.</p>

<p>Looking at the direction of streams, we observe that
there are some which flow northerly, as for instance those
of Siberia, the Nile, the Rhine, the Elbe, and the Weser;
there are those which flow southward—the Indus, Ganges,
Euphrates, La Plata, Mississippi, and Volga, for example;
there are those flowing eastward—Hoang-ho and Yang-tse-Kiang,
the Amazon, the Orinoco, and the Danube, for
instance; and some westward, instances of which may
be found in the Gihon and Sihon, the Senegal, Gambia,
Niger, the Colorado, the Seine, Loire, Garonne, and the
Spanish rivers which enter the sea in Portugal.</p>

<p>And this characteristic, trite and unmeaning as it may
at first seem, establishes, for the area which these rivers
water, very diverse conditions. In like manner, too, their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
position, in relation to the oceans into which they flow, is
very influential, in consequence of the action of the tide
upon the lower course. The emergence of their head-waters
at various altitudes, whether on plateaus of the first or
second class, or on mountain tops covered with perpetual
snow, gives rise to a great diversity of relations, that
makes no one stream on the earth twin brother to any
other. Rivers have an individuality which claims recognition,
although they are usually summed up in one
category.</p>

<p>This diversity in rivers becomes more apparent from a
study of the diversified form of the terraces, or grades of
transition, through which they pass on their way to the sea.</p>

<p>The great basin of the Nile is divided into three distinct
parts or grades—Abyssinia, Nubia, and Egypt; and each
of them has long been studied historically and physically.
The great basin of the Rhine is also naturally divided into
three grades—the Swiss highlands, the German moderate
plateau, and the lowlands of Holland. In a similar manner
there may almost always be traced in rivers three
natural grades, and where they do not have, as in the
cases just cited they do have, a historical significance,
their physical influence is not hard to trace and to follow
into all its analogies.</p>

<p>The word water-shed, now a familiar one, is applied to
that point of division where contiguous springs pour their
water in different directions. It is not even in a mountainous
country necessarily coincident with the highest points
of the chain, though it may be; the valleys may slope in
such a way as to have more influence in determining the
direction of running water than the mountains hard by.
Every stream has its own water-shed system, and this
system is the real boundary of its basin. If we trace this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
basin to its very limits on the highlands, we may find, not
a mile away, the beginnings of another river, which shall
flow in just the contrary direction, as for example in the
case of the Rhine and Rhone, the Volga and the Dwina.
The sources of the Missouri and of the Columbia lie close
together, not a quarter of an hour’s walk apart; yet the
waters of one flow into the Atlantic, of the other into the
Pacific, and their mouths are almost 2500 miles apart.
The Mongolians hold the water-shed in such estimation
that they throw up a heap of stones wherever one occurs,
establish it a shrine for prayer; and the Toongooses of Siberia
never pass by one without casting a cedar branch
upon the stone heap, that, to use their expression, “the
holy mountain that parts the waters may not lessen, but
increase.”</p>

<p>The main channel is the stream proper; the others are
tributaries. The longest tributaries coming in from the
region where the river proper rises, can be grouped intimately
with the source of the main current, hardly distinguished
from it in relative importance—the two, for instance,
in the Nile, the five in the Indus, two in the
Ganges, three in the Amazon, etc. All form in their confluence
the real channel of the river. And the entire body
of tributaries, taken in conjunction with the river proper,
forms the river system, and the district which they all drain
is their true reciprocal. The two, in their mutual action
and reaction, form a whole, and are always thought of together.
The source and the mouth are the beginning and
the end of the whole system; the main channel and the
circuit of water-shed, the center and the circumference of it.
All the tributaries in their union constitute what may be
called the arterial system of the river basin; the form of
each and the characteristics of each are analogous to those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
of the whole, only in reduced pattern. The network which
all the tributaries make is often surprisingly intricate. The
symmetry with which the main characteristics of a river
system are carried into the details, even of its smallest
accessories, can only be compared to that observable in
the architectural regularity of a tree, as it expands from
the main trunk into the countless symmetrical branches.</p>

<p>There are some rivers which are entirely independent
of tributaries—which pursue their way to the sea entirely
alone. Such rivers, however, never belong to the first
class; they are always of subordinate magnitude, and the
humblest of them are mere coast torrents, like those west
of the Andes. Others find their way to no ocean, but lose
themselves in an inland sea or lake, as the Volga does in
the Caspian; as the Gihon and the Sihon do in the Aral;
as the Jordan does in the Dead Sea. Others disappear in
sand wastes or in morasses; such are the rivers of the
African steppes. Others are blocked up, as it were, by
the tidal wave of the ocean, and are thus converted into
estuary lakes.</p>

<p>There are some rivers, also, which remain equally or
nearly equally full the whole year through; there are
others which have their seasons of overflow: the Nile,
for instance, and many rivers whose basin lies within the
region of tropical rains; there are temporary rivers, now
full, now empty, which, if they do not leave, like the torrents
of Arabia, a perfectly dry bed, are traced in the dry
season by a row of stagnant lakes, such, for example, as
are found in the swampy lands of Australia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<h3 id="heading32">Rivers more closely considered.</h3>

<p>What is peculiar to every river is determined by the
abundance of its sources, the forking of its tributaries, the
rate of its descent, the distance from its most remote
springs to its mouth, the main direction of its course,
and the greater or less sinuosities of its channel, as occasioned
by the structure of the country which it traverses.</p>

<p>The abundance of its waters is conditioned by the
greater or less amount of snow which finds the highest
springs, the heavy rains which it receives in tropical countries,
and the exceedingly varied influences which temperate
climates may exert upon it. The fall softens from the
rush and plunge of the mountain district, first to an arrowy
swiftness, then to a moderate course, then to a beautiful
gliding motion, to end with an almost imperceptible flow
just before entering the sea.</p>

<p>The direction of rivers is determined:—</p>

<p>1. By the structure of the region which they traverse,
the layers being in some places horizontal, and in others
tilted to a vertical position; here grouped, as in the granite
Carpathian chain, in such a way that the river courses
which begin there run in parallel lines, radiating like the
rays of a star from a central point; then grouped in such
a manner that a stream may receive tributaries from two
nearly contiguous ranges, as among the spurs of the Ural
Mountains, the Rhone in Valais, receiving waters from
the Bernese Alps at the north, and Pennine Alps at the
south; the Isère, in like manner, the Upper Rhine in
Grisons, the whole Upper Inn in Tyrol.</p>

<p>2. The direction is also determined by the mutual action
of tributaries and the main stream at the point of confluence.
Very often the union of two powerful currents<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
gives rise to a third direction, according to the law known
as the parallelogram of the forces. This generally occurs
when no obstacle stands in the way of their taking a
normal course, and is exemplified in the cases of the Kama
and Volga, the Theiss and Danube, the Rhine and Main, the
Saone and Rhone. Where an obstacle stands in the way,
their abnormal direction is manifested in the abrupt bendings
of the river bed. An instance is found in the bending
of the Rhone northward as it emerges from Valais. Its
lower course, from Lake Geneva to Lyons, betrays the
same angularities, resulting from the obstacles which it
meets and cannot remove. The Rhine, breaking through
the Jura at Basel, is another instance; the Rhine, between
Bingen and Caub, and the Dal-Elf, in Sweden, also exemplify
the same.</p>

<p>In case that rivers meet in their course large masses
of stratified rocks, they force their way through them in
a zigzag direction, making sharp angles always, and not
unfrequently right angles, even. Instances of this are
found in the Rhine, between Mayence and Coblentz, and
in the Moselle, between Treves and Coblentz. When the
river passes beyond these rocky barriers, and meets with
obstructions of a more movable character, it crowds them
more gently and gracefully aside, and leaves a path more
sinuous and wave-like; and yet more gentle are its curves,
as it opens a way through the plains where nothing obstructs
its course. The last is strikingly exemplified in
the rivers of eastern Europe, especially in all those of
middle and southern Russia. The practised eye can determine
the structure of the soil with considerable certainty,
by merely tracing the course of rivers when represented
on a faithful map. For, unless there be other
reasons to prevent, rivers always force their way where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
there is the least resistance to overcome. In stratified
rocks, where the tilt is so great as to make the strata
vertical, the river beds usually run parallel with the lines
of stratification. Instances are found among the Alpine
rocks, in Valais along the Rhone, in Tyrol along the
Inn and Adige, in Grisons, and among the Jura along the
Rhine. Where the lines of stratification are horizontal,
rivers usually take their course through the most marked
ravines and fissures.</p>

<p>In most mountains, however, the lines of stratification
are neither vertical nor horizontal, but intermediate between
them, more or less sloping, as in most marked
ranges of central Germany, for example. In such cases,
the process of excavating river beds has been determined
by various circumstances and conditions, and the direction
of their channels does not alone depend upon the extent
and tilt of the strata, but also on other forces which have
exercised a favoring or a retarding influence on their direct
course. The stratification has its influence, indeed, but it
is general rather than specific. Still, it is very largely
felt when it happens to coincide in its main lines with the
direction of the mountain range, but is comparatively insignificant
when it does not. We have instances in the
Alps where the axis of stratification coincides with that
of the main chain, from south-southwest to north-northeast;
in the Jura, from southwest to northeast; and in
the Scandinavian range, from south to north.</p>

<p>The different geological formations found in mountain
districts have a very important influence in determining
the direction of rivers. Mountains do not generally consist
of rocks of one kind of structure, but of several.
What stratification is to mountains whose geological
formation is the same throughout, the superposition of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
different kinds of rocks is to those of composite materials.
The layers may be divided into superior, inferior, and adjacent.
These usually vary in respect to age, and may be
traced in a regular geological seniority, as for example
sandstone, gypsum, limestone, gray-wacke, and granite.
These formations are either closely contiguous, or are separated
merely by valleys, as for instance in the Carpathian
chain, where the central granite knot is separated by valley
plains from the more southern limestone chain; an example
of contiguity is found on the west spur of the same Carpathian
range. Wherever mountain systems of varied
geological structure approach each other very closely,
rivers seldom break their way through either one, but find
their way along the roots of the mountains, till at last they
come to a less confined place. Such river courses are
often very large and deep; for the mountain streams
which meet and are hemmed in by the narrow pass between
the two contiguous ranges sweep all loose obstructions
before them, and not only leave their path clear,
but continually deepen it. We find this in the Ural, the
Isère, the Rhone, Aar, Inn, in all the long and winding
Alpine valleys, and in the Ebro, fed by the parallel ridges
of the Pyrenees. The circle of rivers which girds the
central Carpathian knot is an illustration of what was said
a moment since. The Poprad, Dunayic, Arva, and Waag are
found where the true Carpathian chain, which is granitic, is
closely contiguous to subordinate ranges of limestone and
gray-wacke. In any accurate map, the long, winding
course between these two chains may be easily traced.
Looking at the point where the Hartz Mountains and the
Thuringian ridge touch at their roots, the groups are seen
to be insulated, as it were, by the rivers which gird their
bases. In the great streams of southern and southwestern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
Asia, too, the line of the water-courses can be traced along
the narrow valleys which separate main from subordinate
mountain chains; the Terek, Kooban, Koor, Aras, Euphrates,
Tigris, Indus, Ganges, and probably the Chinese
rivers, are all examples of this.</p>

<p>Some streams seem to be entirely independent of all
these laws in forming their channels, and to have their
direction assigned to them by the freaks of nature, such,
for instance, as fissures in mountain chains and clefts,
which remain to indicate ancient convulsions.</p>

<p>The entire course of a river is divided into three distinct
and subordinate courses—the upper, middle, and
lower. To these and their respective tributaries correspond
the three grades of transition found on the banks,
and which have already been alluded to. Not only the
total amount of fall in the river bed, but also the angle
of inclination, and the whole complex of phenomena in
the basin, are reciprocal to the threefold character of
transition in almost every hydrographical system in the
world. Still, the variety of relations which arise from the
combination of different elements is so variable, that an
almost infinite diversity arises in the characteristics of
rivers, and these characteristics always vary, too, according
as found in the upper, middle, or lower course.</p>

<h3 id="heading33">Upper Course of Rivers.</h3>

<p>This begins at the ridge of the water-shed, and extends
to the limits where the river emerges from the most rocky
highlands. It depends for its existence upon the greater
fall in the river bed there than lower down. At the upper
course, therefore, rivers which may flow in exactly opposite
directions are brought into direct neighborhood. The farther
they advance from the water-shed the more they recede<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
from each other. In the High Forest south of the
Carpathian chain, and in the Bory Morass north of it, the
waters which flow into the Baltic and into the Black Seas
spring from the ground side by side. The name given to
the districts where the head-waters of large and navigable
rivers part is usually the French word portages, the
English word transports being little used in that connection,
although all, the German Trageplatze and the Russian
Wolok, involve the idea of <i>carrying</i>, of porterage, from
the head-waters of one stream to those of another. The
lowest parts of a water-shed, the passes of a high mountain
range, for example, the intermediate vales of lower
ones, and the most elevated plains in flat districts, are the
most suitable for the purpose of canal building, to serve
as a connecting link between the sources of divergent
streams; as, for instance, the canal which is proposed to
connect the Baltic and the Black Seas by uniting the
Vistula and Danube, the tributaries, the Poprad, Hernad,
and Theiss being the channel of communication up to the
mountains where a canal is to pass over the water-shed
formed by the valleys of the Carpathian chain. Such a
communication is the most available which can be made
between the opposite sides of a mountain range. The
practicability of constructing such canals depends very
largely upon the degree of fall in the upper course of the
connected rivers, as determined by the slope of the bed
toward the horizon. The grade of most mountains’ sides,
which stand back to back, is unlike on the two sides:
steep on the one, slight on the other. Upon this depends
the greater or less wildness of the streams flowing through
their upper course. In the Ural chain the slope is steep on
the eastern side, gradual on the western; in the Caucasus,
steep on the north, gradual on the south; in the Carpathian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
and the Alps, just the reverse—steep on the south,
gradual on the north. The rate of fall varies; but, in
general, it lies between an angle of 2° and an angle of 6°,
taking the entire upper course into account. On the
very steep north side of the Pyrenees, the fall is between
3° and 4°; on the south side of the Alps, from the summits
of Mont Rosa and Mont Blanc to the plains of Piedmont,
it is 3¾°. It is far less in more unimportant ranges.
And this angle, it should be remarked, is an average; it is
the resultant of a great number of special, short slopes,
which vary from the perpendicularity of an occasional
waterfall to the equally occasional tranquillity of a meadow-like
flow. The incidental slopes are, of course, much
greater than the average of all. A grade of 15° is very
steep; it is the maximum that can be ascended by a beast
of burden. A grade of 8° is the maximum for wheeled
vehicles; all roads must be less sloping than this. To
accomplish the ascent of 35°, a man on foot must have
some assistance. A grade of 44° in the high peaks of
Mexico and Peru, Humboldt found inaccessible; only
where the growth of trees and shrubs gave him an
opportunity of planting his feet, could he climb where it
was a little steeper than 44°. The Carpathians and the
Pyrenees, on account of their steepness and their scanty
verdure, are very difficult to ascend. The Alps are much
more easily climbed than the mountains just mentioned, in
consequence of their abundant growth of turf and undergrowth.
The richest Alpine meadows of Switzerland
have an inclination not exceeding 20°; at a greater slope
the vegetation becomes more sparse. The grade on which
it is possible for earth to cling, Lehman fixes at 45°, and
considers that the normal slope, because at a greater angle,
rain glances or ricochets. But Lehman is not right in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
assigning this as the normal slope possible for earth to
cling and vegetation to grow, for on the Alps soil adheres
and plants get a footing at a much steeper angle
than 45°; in fact, the modifications in the appearance of
the Alps, by the growth of trees clinging to steeper
slopes than this, are very marked. From the highest
possible grade where vegetation can get a footing, we
advance to the sheer perpendicular.</p>

<p>The upper course of rivers is characterized rather by
plunges than by equable flowing, and determines its way
by a series of leaps through zigzag cuts and various ravines.
It traverses bowl-shaped hollows and narrow defiles,
and makes its way even through mountain lakes,
depositing in them its residuum of sand and gravel
which it has caught up and swept along. In its wild
plunges it draws into its body considerable air, which appears
as bubbles, and makes it a white mass of foam.
By-and-by it reaches more level ground, becomes clear as
crystal, and assumes a rich emerald green, or a deep blue.
It is unnavigable, wild, romantic, and is always found in
mountain districts.</p>

<p>The brawling brooks of Salzburg, of the Pyrenees, and
of Sweden and Norway, all partake of this character.
Those of the Pyrenees have a fall of an inch in every
foot, and in some places cataracts of two or three feet.
The same is observable in the Alps, where the continual
stir of the water mixes in air enough to turn all into a
mass of silvery-white foam. The Carpathian waters are
the same before they reach the high plateaus lying at their
feet. The Alpine lakes, too, which lie within the upper
course of the rivers which feed them, have a considerable
fall; Lago Maggiore, for instance, has a descent of 52 feet
between Magadino and Arona.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p>In all the most marked mountain systems of Europe,
the upper course of the rivers is especially prominent.
Northern Europe is characterized by the fact that its
streams have, throughout the most of their length, the peculiarities
of the upper course—whether observed in northern
Russia, in all Sweden, Norway, and Scotland.</p>

<p>With the exit of the river from the mountain district,
all these relations are changed, and a new character
begins.</p>

<h3 id="heading34">The Middle Course.</h3>

<p>Far more moderate is the descent after the river emerges
from the mountain region, or where it has never experienced
the wild turbulence of the upper course, as is the
case in most of the rivers of eastern Europe. In the middle
course the angle of inclination is much modified. The
upper Main has a fall of 342 feet within three miles after
leaving Fichtel Mountains. The descent of most of the
rivers of central Germany is much less than this. The
Neckar, whose sources lie 2084 feet above the sea, in
passing to Heilbronn, which is 450 feet above the sea,
falls at the rate of about an inch to every 32 feet. The
fall of the Saale, after leaving the Fichtel range, is about
20 feet to the mile; that of Naab, about 14; that of the
Eger, less; and that of the upper Oder, in Silesia, still
less. More gradual yet is the slope of the Volga bed,
which falls but 1400 in about 2050 miles, considerably
less than a foot to a mile; and in its lower course its inclination
must be still less.</p>

<p>The effects of the current must necessarily be very different
from those observable under the influence of the
dashing and wayward upper course.</p>

<p>The name River Bed is given to the entire breadth of
the hollow which holds the river, and which varies in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
width according to the stage of the water, especially in
large streams like the great rivers of America. The Mississippi
is a mile wide at Natchez at low water, at high
water almost thirty. The Orinoco, at St. Thomas, is three
miles wide at low water, at high water it is over seventy.
In the Volga and the Danube the stage of water makes
great differences in the width of the river bed. In summer
the depth and breadth are, as a rule, less than in winter.</p>

<p>The Channel differs from the river bed; it is the
part of the river bed which gives life and motion to the
whole current. In the upper course the channel and the
river bed generally coincide; in the middle and lower
courses, on the contrary, the channel occupies but a very
small share of the whole bed, but yet it determines the
direction, amount of fall, and the rapidity of the stream.
It lies usually not in the middle of the river bed, but on
one side; it passes, however, from bank to bank; it is indicated
by the movement of ships, which always follow it,
and it lies uniformly adjacent to the boldest shore. It
widens the whole river bed toward one side, and not toward
both; and so streams which traverse great plains,
like the great Hungarian one, for instance, do not now run
through the middle, but course along at the base of the
marginal bluffs. In all such cases, it will be found that
the channel hugs the boldest side of the bed. All the
four Carpathian rivers, as they wind out between the
main range and the subordinate ranges, have their steepest
shore, not on the side of the loftiest, but on the side
of the boldest mountains, and these are the ones of the
subordinate range. So, in the plains which lie between
the Swiss Alps and the Jura, the bold sides of the river
bed lie on the side of the bolder though less important
chain, and not on the side of the Alpine meadows. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
bold banks of the Ebro are not on the side of the Pyrenees
and their plains, but on the south side. All the
streams of South and Middle Russia have, therefore, on
the east side, their low banks, on the west the bold ones;
and this, because the most extensive plains lie on the
eastern side.</p>

<p>In the more level tracts the windings of rivers are very
much increased in magnitude. These windings check the
current. The serpentine course is characteristic of rivers
in their middle course, and it is repeated, though on a
small scale, in every meadow brook. The serpentine
course of rivers gives rise to countless islands and intervals:
as, for example, between Bâle and the Rhinegau,
but, with very few exceptions, no lakes, the characteristic
feature of the upper course of rivers. But the broad
meadow lands of the middle course very often indicate in
the clearest manner that they were once lakes of considerable
magnitude, which have subsided and left their
basin a dry plain. An example may be found in the
meadow land of the Rhine, from Bâle to Bastberg, below
Strasbourg, and again from Ladenburg, in the Palatinate,
to Bingen. So on the Danube, from Ulm to Passau,
Lintz, and Kloster Newburg, and again from Pesth to Beloro
Semlin, as far, in fact, as the narrows at Orsova. The
same feature is met in the middle course of the Volga,
from Tver eastward to the west Ural, and southward to
Saratov and Kamishin, where it breaks through the
Obstshei-Syrtis, which was, doubtless, once the barrier of
a great inland lake. In these basins, now dry, there is a
surprising uniformity of characteristics wherever on the
globe they occur. They differ but little, whether found in
the middle course of the Ganges, the Indus, the Euphrates,
or the American rivers. The still, incomplete stream of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
the St. Lawrence shows us, even in the present, what the
ancient conditions were before they solved the problem of
their complete development. There, a row of such lakes
as formerly existed in the now fruitful plains of the middle
Rhine, the middle Danube, and central Russia, are the
five great Canadian lakes. They still constitute the middle
course of the river, and one pours itself directly into
another, either over a gentle slope of land, or in a great
cataract and rapids, such as we do not observe in the
middle course of other streams, which are not, like the
St. Lawrence, incomplete. Only when waterfalls disappear
can the inclination of rivers become a gradual one.
The uniformity of the grade of their channel is, therefore,
a sign that they have attained to a complete development.
In such, slight rapids remain, instead of the ancient
cataracts. The existence of those primeval falls we find
in all rivers, even in the Rhine and Danube. The rounded
faces of the rocks which once were the barriers to the
rivers’ course, and the debris once swept down from the
mountains and deposited over the bottom of the ancient
lakes, show this.</p>

<p>The strongest instance of cataracts, resembling the ancient
ones which connected the lakes of nearly all the
great rivers of the globe, is seen in the fall of Niagara.
That cataract is an epitome of the falls of all other
streams. The Niagara River conducts the water of Lake
Erie, by a channel 33 miles long, to Lake Ontario, 300 feet
below it. At the Great Fall the river plunges about 150
feet into a chasm which it has hollowed out from the soft
stone between the two lakes. The cataract was formerly
seven miles below its present location, and has been observed
to be steadily working backward since its discovery.
In the distant future it will, doubtless, wholly disappear, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
all others have done. For the Niagara is merely a striking
instance of a principle once universal, but which
merely worked itself out on a smaller scale. The more
fragments of rock and mountain debris were swept along,
the sooner were the primitive falls rent away by the wash
and the percussion, and the development of the middle
course completed.</p>

<p>The places of transition which lie between the higher
dry basins and the lower ones are still to be traced in almost
all rivers; not by great waterfalls, which belong only
to the upper course, but by simple rapids. They are more
or less characterized by narrows, with steep, rocky banks,
where, doubtless, cataracts existed in the primitive times.
They are recognizable by this feature, that they are uniformly
alike, and distribute their force equally on both
sides of the river. Examples may be found on both sides
of the Rhine, in the narrows between Bingen and Bacharach;
on the Elbe, from Tetshen to Shandau, Dresden,
and Meissen. In these places the rivers have a very
tortuous course, and there are whirls and rapids (rapides,
sauts, of the French; saltos, randales, of the Spanish;
schewerin of the Russians) which impede navigation. In
these localities the entire aspect of nature is changed, and
the landscape becomes exceedingly beautiful. Here we
find ancient narrow roadways; here are places of great
historic interest, and of great interest to the naturalist, assuredly
not of accidental origin, but in close connection
with the development of the river bed, and in close
analogy with all places of transition from highland to
lowland.</p>

<p>We may, perhaps, mark these features in all the rivers
of the earth. A knowledge of them is essential to understand
thoroughly the natural development of a river system<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
in its true parts; unfortunately, they have as yet been
too little observed and described. Among European
rivers they are found in the Guadiana, at the Saltos de
Lobo; in the Douro, at the rapids below Torre de Moncorvo;
in the Ebro, at Sastago, below Saragossa; in the
Rhone, the rapids below Lyons, between the granite banks
of Pierre Encise; in Loire, by Iguerando, below Roanne;
in the Rhine, below Strasbourg, and at the narrows at
Bingen, near St. Goar and Andernach; in the Weser, at
the Porta Westphalica; in the Danube, at Grein, at Kloster
Newburg, and at Yachtali, Drenir Kapi, (Iron Gate,)
and Orsova; and in the Dnieper, the thirteen waterfalls
below Yekaterinslav. The same features are repeated in
all the other streams of Europe and the remaining continents.
More close investigation of them will lead to important
results, concerning the structure of the earth in
the regions intermediate between plateaus and lowlands.</p>

<p>As a high grade, great cataracts, sharp and bold cliffs,
and mountain lakes characterize the upper course of
streams, so rapids, dry lake basins, and a meandering
channel characterize their middle course. Below the
lowest rapids are found the level plains or lowlands
which give rivers their third characteristic.</p>

<h3 id="heading35">Lower Course.</h3>

<p>As soon as the rivers break through the lowest range
of hills which once beset their course, they deposit the
debris which they bear with them, and begin the formation
of diluvial plains. We find in the soil of all level
places along the middle, as well as the lower course of
rivers, traces of the same kinds of rock and minerals,
which characterize the mountains where they rise. The
rate of fall in the lower course of rivers is so slight as to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
be almost imperceptible. Relatively, it is the greatest in
the Volga; from Kamishin to the Caspian the descent is
more than 150 feet, although the distance is less than 500
miles. The Senegal, from Podor to the sea, a distance of
about 200 miles, falls only about 2½ feet; the Amazon,
within about the same distance, falls only 10½ feet, or about
an inch to the mile. In such rivers, therefore, the tide can
flow a very long way inland.</p>

<p>This gives rise to a great conflict of forces—the pressure
of the stream in its natural flow, heightened at the appropriate
season by the annual inundation, and the backward
pressure of the tidal wave. Before these forces
come into equilibrium, the river bed is constantly changing.
The river proper seeks this equilibrium by a parting
of its channel, dividing into two mouths, as in the Nile,
or into more than one, as in the Rhine and Danube, or
several (about 65) in the Volga. The momentum of the
stream, the resistance of the tide, and the consequent slow
speed of the current promote the fall of deposits along the
lower course of rivers. Below the surface the result of
these deposits is found in sand banks or bars; above the
surface, as low, marshy land, the deltas, subject to frequent
inundation. We see this in the Rhine, the Nile,
the Euphrates, the Indus, the Ganges, the Mississippi—in
all, about fourteen of the first-class rivers of the globe.
The contrary feature, single, broad mouths not yet filled
up by alluvial deposits, negative deltas, or deep ocean inlets,
can be observed in nine others of the largest rivers—the
Obi, Yenisei, St. Lawrence, Columbia, La Plata—mostly
found, however, in the north of the earth, where
there is very little of the more loose and fruitful soil which
more southern rivers bear onward from the mountains
where they rise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>Another peculiarity of the lower course is seen in the
extraordinary changes in the river bed—the shifting of the
channel from one side to the other. This is the natural
result of the very light and movable character of the deposits
brought down from above, and the strong pressure
of the current, which, though slow, has great momentum.
In the lower course of the Ganges, Indus, Euphrates, Nile,
Rhine, and Po, these changes can be traced as a matter
of history, and, in the lapse of centuries, have had great influence
on the formation of the great plains of those
rivers’ mouths and on the people living there. With the
lower course begins the regular yearly inundations, which
cover vast districts in tropical countries; and to these
inundations may be attributed the gradual raising of the
level of the plains covered by them. Hence arose Herodotus’
descriptive phrase ποταμοὶ ἐργατιχοί, (prolific rivers.)
The great fruitfulness of these lowlands is well known.
The rich alluvial deposits have made Bengal, Babylonia,
Egypt, Lombardy, Holland, and the Netherlands the
granaries of all neighboring countries.</p>

<p>In proportion as the mouth of great rivers resembles an
inland sea, having a strongly marked tidal flow in sympathy
with the ocean, does the whole nature of the lower
course vary. The rivers whose mouths are turned to the
east and south are those which are exposed to the strongest
and the highest ocean waves. Such are Chinese, Indian,
and South American rivers, which sometimes show
the result of this, 500 miles inland. The tide extending
so far into the interior facilitates navigation very much,
and transforms the lowlands along their margin into districts,
which seem transitional between true continent and
oceanic islands. All the mouths of first-class rivers which
open toward the north and west are less deeply affected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
by the entrance of the sea waves. To these belong most
of the European streams. Exceptional to both of these
classes are the three rivers, the Nile, Danube, and Volga,
whose direction is not toward the ocean, but toward the
center of the Old World. They form a triad, not of
oceanic, but of continental streams; in them there is no
ebb and flood. Their lower course and mouths must,
therefore, display different relations from those of any
other of the great rivers of the globe.</p>

<p>It was early remarked that not all streams, when they
reach the sea, flow at once into it, but come to a standstill.
It is so with the Thames, and with most of the
North American rivers. The ocean sometimes throws
a tidal wave twenty to thirty feet high up their channel,
and dams their flow. Rivers vary exceedingly in their
relations to this high barrier. The Chinese streams are
sometimes raised forty feet by it above their normal level.
This gives rise to a salt oceanic river, so to speak. It is
the same with the Thames at London. At high tide the
surface is salt, while the water at the bottom is fresh.
The struggle with the downward current and the upward
current is very often visible. It is so in the Orinoco, the
Ganges, in the Chinese rivers; most of all, in the St.
Lawrence.</p>

<p>In all the continents there are many small rivers and rivulets
which have no normal mouths; which lose themselves
in the earth before they reach the sea. Sometimes they
pursue a subterranean course, and emerge again, though
usually with a changed name. Among the best-known
of such instances is the Perte du Rhone, below Geneva,
where the river flows for a little way directly beneath a
spur of the Jura Mountains. In like manner, the Meuse,
which loses itself in the earth at Bazoilles, in the Vosges<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
Mountains, west of Nancy, flows in a subterranean bed
as far as Noncourt, nine miles distant, and then emerges.
The phenomenon is common among the Jura, and in the
limestone cliffs which feed the Drave and Save. The
tourist meets almost hourly there some brook or little
river disappearing beneath the ground. On the high
Asiatic plateau of Gobi, 68 rivers are known, which disappear
in a similar manner; in the north of Thibet there
are 115 such. They are common, also, in the Chinese
province of Yun-nan, on the Persian highland, and on the
plateau of the Bechuanas, in South Africa. In South
America, between the Andes and the La Plata, there are
twelve lakes without effluents, the greatest being Lake Titicaca.
In Central America, there is the Lake of Mexico.</p>

<p>The division of the whole length of a river into the
three courses—the upper, middle, and lower—and the proportionate
share which each of these bears to the whole,
depends upon the height at which the source stands above
the mouth. The greater or less extent of the transition
grades, and the greater or less extent of navigable waters,
also depend on the same. The upper course has, as a
general rule, too many hinderances to be very valuable for
navigation; it is, at best, adapted only to boats. The
more united and deeper middle course offers facilities for
vessels of considerable draught; yet the frequent sunken
rocks and eddies and rapids are a great impediment to navigation.
We find it so in the Rhine, below the Falls of
Schaffhausen, as far as Bâle; and in its middle course, at
Bingen and St. Goar; in the Danube, also, at Grein and
Orsova.</p>

<p>The lower course, on the other hand, opens like a broad
fresh-water sea, that sometimes allows large ships to sail
50, 200, and even 500 miles inland. These maritime<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
streams ought to be discriminated from others; the
Chinese call them “sons of the ocean.”</p>

<p>The proportions in the length of the upper, middle, and
lower course of rivers are exceedingly variable; and equally
variable of course are the transition lands apportioned to
each, and forming its natural supplement. The upper
course of the Volga is very short, the middle very long,
and the lower very short. The same relative proportions,
though with very different dimensions, are found in the Vistula,
the Ganges, the Euphrates, and the Mississippi. The
upper course of the Rhine, on the contrary, is very long,
through all Switzerland to Bâle; the middle also very long,
to Cologne; the lower, very short, to Rotterdam and the sea.
It is the same with the Nile, the Danube, and the Indus.
In the Marañon or Amazon the upper course is very
short, the middle and lower very long. In the Chinese
rivers Hoang-ho and Yang-tse-Kiang all the three courses
are relatively long.</p>

<p>The length of the middle and lower courses, although
important conditions of navigation, are not the only ones.
Others are not to be overlooked,—the amount of water,
depth of channel, and the like. These, however, are not
capable of being generalized under any law, but depend
upon the individual characteristics of each stream. Every
river needs, for an exhaustive account of its features, its
own monograph.</p>

<p>There remains but one important point to be considered—one
which has exerted a very great influence on the diversity
of structure in all river systems, controlling the
area of their drainage, their volume of water, their effect
on human culture, and on the ethnographic character of
the people dwelling on their banks. It is the distance
from the source to the mouth in direct distance compared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
with that following the tortuous course of the stream.
The two lines almost never coincide; they generally lie
far apart. And the less they approach to coincidence, the
greater becomes the area of the river basin; the more
numerous and valuable the tributaries to the main course,
the greater the volume of the stream and the more varied
and extensive its influence.</p>

<p>One or two examples drawn from European rivers will
more fully explain this point, to which Buache has already
called attention in his “Parallèle des fleuves.”</p>

<p>The mouth of the Volga is 982 miles distant from the
source, in an air-line. The distance, including all the
curves of the stream, is 2012 miles, the bendings adding
1028 miles to the direct course. By this doubling of the
shortest possible distance, the area drained by it is swollen
to the enormous size of 657,000 square miles. The direct
course lies in a diagonal direction from northwest to southeast;
but the real direction is a changing one. First, it
flows a short distance from north to south, then in its
middle course it has a double direction; first eastward,
toward the Ural chain, then to the south, and lastly, in
its lower course, to the southeast. Through this varied
course it receives tributaries from very remote sources, and
waters a country altogether greater than would be possible
if the Volga’s course were direct from the source to
the mouth. Its basin becomes so large as to embrace a
fifth of Europe, and the stream becomes one of the longest
and most available for navigation in the continent. The
vastness of the volume of water and the wandering course
have both contributed to the value of the Volga lowlands.</p>

<p>The exact contrast to the Volga is found in the Dniester.
In the Volga there is a maximum of windings; in the
Dniester there is a minimum. The air-line distance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
the mouth of the Dniester from the source is 408 miles;
the distance, including all the bends, is 450 miles; the loss
in winding is, therefore, but about 42 miles. The theoretical
course of the Dniester, <i>i.e.</i> measured by an air-line,
would coincide very nearly with its actual course. There
cannot be, therefore, any distant springs whose waters
flow into its channel; its basin is one of the most contracted
in the world in consequence of its directness; and
a small belt, embracing but 32,850 square miles, comprehends
the entire district that it drains, freed from all
those tributaries which make the Volga basin so important.</p>

<p>The Dnieper, its eastern neighbor, is 630 miles in direct
distance from the source to the mouth, but 1000 with all
its windings; leaving 370 miles as the extraneous shore,
which adds to the value of the basin, and contributes to
the 219,000 square miles which it drains.</p>

<p>The same contrast is seen elsewhere, though not on so
extended a scale. It is to be found in the Vistula, Oder,
Elbe, Weser, Rhine, and Danube. These rivers give shape
to the transition terraces between broad eastern Europe
and the more contracted western portions of the continent;
their dimensions are, therefore, on a less extensive
scale than in the great Russian streams. Still, the differences
in them are worthy of notice.</p>

<p>In the Vistula, the direct distance from the source to
the mouth is 329 miles, and the real distance is 611 miles;
the windings comprise, therefore, 280 miles, or about two-thirds
of the air-line from extreme to extreme. It becomes
able to receive a large number of tributaries, and its basin
is enlarged to an area of 78,402 square miles, becoming
one of the best-watered and most fruitful on the globe.</p>

<p>In the Oder, the direct distance from the source to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
mouth is about the same as in the Vistula. But while
the latter frequently changes its course, running first
northward, then eastward to the Sau, then northward
again to the Bug, then westward to the Drewenz, and lastly
northward, and so gains a very large basin of drainage, the
former is unvarying in its course from southeast to northwest;
so that the direct line drawn from extreme to extreme,
as the bird flies, is nearly coincident with the actual
course of the river. The windings do not, at most, comprise
one-third of the whole length of the stream, and the
basin drained by its tributaries is at least a third less than
that of the Vistula, and is proportionately less valuable to
the interests of the world.</p>

<p>In the Elbe the air-line length is 394 miles, greater
therefore, than that of the Vistula or the Oder; its length,
including its windings, is about the same as that of the
Vistula. The area of its basin lies therefore between
the two, 61,320 square miles; it is more valuable, therefore,
than that of the Oder, and less valuable than that of
the Vistula.</p>

<p>Still less striking in this respect are the Weser and the
Ems; but the Rhine assumes a prominence, in relation to
the value of its basin, greater than even the Vistula. The
direct distance from the source of the Rhine to its mouth is
423 miles, the actual distance 705 miles; the windings
comprise, therefore, more than two-thirds of the entire
length of the stream. The number of tributaries is uncommonly
large, the area drained is increased about 9855
miles beyond that of the Vistula; and the entire basin
(88,257 square miles) is one which has been of the greatest
import in the history of all central Europe.</p>

<p>All the rivers and all the terrace lands of the globe exhibit
the same relation which we have been briefly indicating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
in a few European ones; in some of the great
rivers of the world they are to be traced on a scale of
grandeur of which in those which have been touched
upon scarcely a suggestion is given.</p>

<p>But not in this feature, added to what has been already
said, do we exhaust the fruitful subject of Rivers, and the
terrace systems which accompany them from their source
to the sea. The diversity of phenomena traceable in them
had hid their unity from geographers, and prevented their
tracing general principles in so manifold details. The dry,
linear representations on most of our maps have blinded the
eye to the living and organic relations which river systems
enter into, and through which they exert a great influence.
They must be examined singly; they must be studied in
their real character and individuality, and each must have
its own monograph, before we can fully know the value of
river systems to the world.</p>

<p>We have now to touch upon one or two points omitted,
thus far, in our discussion of the hydrography of the continents.</p>

<p>The stream is a unit; most streams have a single channel
as the last goal of their descent. Others may have double
channels, which contend with each other for the superiority.
If they are double only for a part of the whole
length of the river, and in the upper or middle course flow
together, and form one main channel, they can be called
twin head-streams. We have an example in the Danube
and Inn, which are equally long and equally large. Other
instances are the Rhone and the Saone, the Volga and
Kama, the Missouri and Mississippi, the Blue and White
Nile, the Ganga and Jumna. Others have triple head-streams;
as, for example, the Hither, Middle, and Farther
Rhine; the Ucayale, Huallaga, and Marañon, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
combine in the middle course to form the Amazon. There
may be even five head-streams, as in the Indus. Often it
is only through the usage of speech, often through ancient
and exploded errors, that the name of one of the head-streams
is given to the whole river.</p>

<p>If the double channels continue through the whole
length of the river system, they belong to a different category;
they become true double systems, and have a double
influence on the development of the whole range of terraces
from source to base. From their meeting in a common
bay or gulf at the mouth, they may be called sister-streams;
and, from the territory which they inclose between
them, the Mesopotamia, they may be called Mesopotamic
streams. Between such double streams some of the
greatest States of Asia lie. Universally known, on account
of their influence on Asiatic culture, are the Euphrates
and Tigris uniting in the Persian Gulf, Ganges
and Brahmapootra uniting in the Bay of Bengal, Gihon
and Sihon in the Sea of Aral, Hoang-ho and Yang-tse-Kiang
encompassing the Central Flowery Country of the
Chinese Empire, and meeting in a common delta. These
double streams are mostly met in Asia, and they have exercised
a great influence on the whole growth of oriental
civilization.</p>

<p>In South America there is yet another and more complex
form yet of river system. The Amazon is connected
with the Orinoco by means of the little cross-river Cassiquiare.
By this connection the middle course of both
rivers is made more available to navigation than it would
otherwise have been. Such cross-streams may be found,
though on a smaller scale, in other continents; in Africa,
for example, between the Senegal and the Rio Grande.
There a network is made between the parallel rivers, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
it is available for navigation only in the wet seasons. In
Central Africa there seems to be a similar phenomenon between
the eastern tributaries of Lake Tchad and the
western tributaries of the Bahr el Abiad or White Nile,
though this rests on the authority of the Arabs. In India
there appears to be a similar connection between the
middle course of the Indus and the Jumna, and so the
Ganges, by the mediation of the Sarasvati or Histara and
the Gharghara. There may have been the same in Central
China, between the Hoang-ho and the Kiang, where
the Imperial Canal now runs; and a similar feature may
be found in the Lithuanian marshes, connecting the Vistula
and Dnieper river systems, through the mediation of
the Bug and the Przypec. The skill of man has, in many
places, accomplished the same end by the construction of
canals.</p>

<p>Although all rivers, in the course of their development,
follow the universal law which leads them from their
source, however high, to the sea, yet there is, even in their
descent, scope for exceedingly varied phenomena. It is
not necessary that everywhere a strongly-marked line of
water-shed should exist, but often, as in all the more level
plateaus, there are broad, neutral plains which perform
the function of water-sheds, though possessing no decisive
character. It is so through a great part of Central Asia,
in the low plains of Australia, probably in a large part of
Africa, and so markedly in America, that all lines of
water-shed wholly disappear, and the rivers flow confusedly
together, without any system, and in obedience to
no law.</p>

<p>Some rivers come down the sides of high mountains in
torrents, then course around in a long, winding course,
turning out for all obstacles, and at last find the sea.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
Others are entirely unlike them. The Ganges flows from
the south side of the Himalaya Mountains, and courses
along their base, following the direction of the chain in a
southeasterly direction, till it reaches the Bay of Bengal.
The Indus springs from the north side of the Himalaya,
flows northwest over the plateau of Little Thibet as far
as Iskardo, then breaks through the whole chain to pour
itself out upon the lowlands of India, the Punjaub, and
Mooltan. Dashing its way through the most formidable
barriers, it is entirely unlike the gentle Ganges, which
pursues its tranquil course through the plains, meeting no
barrier in its entire length. The Indus, so long as it remains
north of the Himalaya, traverses a plateau 10,000
feet above the sea; while the Ganges, even at Delhi, is but
1000 feet above the sea. Both rivers, although represented
in precisely the same way upon the maps, have an
entirely different physical character.</p>

<p>The same difference in structure occurs in the streams
of other continents, and even in those of Central Europe,
though on a less colossal scale. There are, therefore,
classes of rivers, and they ought to be just as sharply discriminated
as the classes in botany and zoology.</p>

<p>Plateau streams, such as the Danube, as far as the
Lower Austrian and Hungarian plains, and the Saone,
down to its confluence with the Rhone, pass through high,
uniform plains with little fall. They are genuine mountain
followers, springing from the verge of the chain and
crossing along its base, the Saone taking the west side of
the Alps, as the Danube does the northern, and the Po the
southern.</p>

<p>The rivers which force their way through mountain
ranges form a second class. The Rhine, a free child of
the Alps, from its source to the sea, breaks through all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
the ranges up to the Jura; then it forces a path through
all the mountains of Central Germany, till it comes to its
lower course. It may, therefore, be classified with the
Indus. It leaves the Alps suddenly at Bâle, and opens a
new and romantic way through no insignificant obstacle,
and is everywhere a conqueror. That is the peculiarity
of the Rhine.</p>

<p>Two streams of analogous nature, though less marked
in their characteristics, are the Elbe and the Weser. But
these both rise, not among the Alps, but amid the German
mountains. They lack, therefore, the exceedingly romantic
character of Alpine rivers; but they do not lack in picturesque
scenery, and this they owe to the obstacles which
they pass. The Elbe has broken its way from the Bohemian
ridge through the so-called Saxon-Switzerland, as
far as Meissen, and the Weser from the fissures of the
Werra and the Fulda to the Porta Westphalica. The
Elbe and the Weser make, with the Rhine, the triad of
Central European rivers, which have broken a pathway
for themselves through mountains which impeded their
course.</p>

<p>A third class of rivers are those which encounter no
obstacles, and flow in a placid stream from the source to
the mouth. They extend in Europe from the Vistula to
the Ems, including the Oder and excluding the Weser and
Elbe, and from the Rhine along the whole Atlantic coast
of France, embracing the Seine, Loire, Garonne, and the
Adour—all of these having, in greater or less degree, the
same hydrographical character.</p>

<p>From these can be still further discriminated the subordinate
coast rivers.</p>

<p>To a fourth class belong all those tributary streams, of
whatever size or length, which agree in possessing no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
independent character, and do not pour their waters into
the sea through their own mouths.</p>

<p>The application of this system of classification can be
applied to the streams and their accompanying terrace
lands in the other continents. But these observations may
suffice to indicate the general principles which we would
apply to the study of rivers, and leave to the student their
further application.</p>

<h3 id="heading36">Review.</h3>

<p>The great typical forms already considered, highland,
plateau, mountain, lowland, terrace, and river, which all
claim so large a share of attention in studying their physical
characteristics, are no less worthy of careful attention,
in consequence of their influence on human culture. Our
account would not be complete without devoting a few
pages to the consideration of the manner in which nature
and history have reacted on each other.</p>

<p>The most elevated highlands, the loftiest plateaus, uniform
in their aspect, immense in their extent, isolated,
without trees, having the thin soil characteristic of steppes,
and useful only for grazing, are the home of the primitive
nomadic races. Without forests and without shelter, without
valleys and without water-courses, with sandy and
rocky soil, covered with a scanty vegetation, they serve
only to supply food for the gregarious animals which follow
man, and to furnish a home to wandering tribes of herdsmen.
Instances are found in Central Asia, in Toorkistan
and Persia, in Central Africa, including the Galla tribes
and the Abyssinians. So, too, among the high plateaus
of America, the home of the primitive Aztecs. From
such places came the first movements of emigration; from
the high plateaus of Central Asia came the wandering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
Persians, Huns, Mongolians, and Turks; and the same
course of emigration was witnessed among the negro
tribes of Central Africa, proceeding from the Galla tribes.
The lower highlands, less colossal in size, of more moderate
height, and of more genial temperature, have at all times
reached a certain low stage of culture, after giving a home
to the nomads from the higher plateau; but have never
developed that culture to any considerable extent. We
find examples of this in the high terraces of Bootan, the
Deccan, and Persia; in Africa, among the Atlas mountains;
in Abyssinia, in the ancient Greek Arcadia, in
Castile, in Arvernia, (Auvergne,) in Gallia, in Hesse, in
the Eifel, and on the Valdai hills.</p>

<p>In the exceedingly complex, subdivided, and romantic
mountain districts of the globe, the races have attained,
by virtue of the variety of their resources and the energy
of their stock, to the highest results of civilization, and
have manifested the most independent and progressive
spirit. In such regions, hunting, working in wood, the
settled life of shepherds, working in metals, agriculture on
such terrace lands as those of Nepaul, Cashmere, Palestine,
the Lebanon, Apennine, and other ranges, fruit culture,
tilling vineyards, the cultivation of all kinds of industry,
as in Central Germany and in most regions of the
temperate zone, develop most thoroughly and speedily the
culture of a people. In such occupations men learn to
lean more on each other, and grow into that diversity of
occupation and division of labor, which are the latest results
of civilization. The Zend, the Sanscrit, and the Persian
nations which people the fertile tracts at the base of the
Himalaya Mountains, from Maghada, Lahore, Nepaul, and
Cashmere, as far as Persepolis and Hamadan, Susa and
Shiraz, the inhabitants of the hill country of Palestine and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
Syria, those of the Tehama range of mountains in Arabia,
those in the moderately elevated meadows of Gondar,
as well as those in all the European Alpine lands, Switzerland,
Tyrol, Styria, as well as the inhabitants of the mountain
region of Peru and Mexico, all attain to an early and
considerably advanced state of civilization. Other nations
have found in mountains asylums in time of danger—the
Tsherkeses and Ossetes among the Caucasus, for instance,
the Basques among the Pyrenees, and the Gorals among
the Carpathians.</p>

<p>The lowlands, as soon as the water had left them enough
to make them habitable, have become, from the first, the
abodes of a teeming population; and there has been the
same blending of races in the most ancient as in the most
recently settled, in China as in Texas, and, in truth, all
North America. Often these inroads of population have
been a source of injury, as has been the case in the northern
Siberian plains, where the Finnish tribes have made
their homes, and in the waste of Sahara, where the Barbary
tribes, the Bedouins, the Tibboos, and the Tuaricks
have made their retreat.</p>

<p>On the fruitful terraces, along the middle course of
rivers, the earliest fixed habitations and ripened culture
have been attained. Through the traditional handing
down of past results, and by the habits of peace, their
inhabitants have more thoroughly subjected nature and
advanced to a higher state of civilization than the dwellers
in the interior, away from the rivers. It has been the
same, in a great measure, with the lower course, as, for
instance, in Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, and Bengal; and
in Europe, in Lombardy, Holland, and the Netherlands,
where, to the efforts to recover land from the sea, have been
added fishing and commerce. On such fruitful tracts as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
the mouths and middle courses of rivers water, nations
could find a permanent home, and pass quickly to all
liberal and refining arts and occupations. This is clear,
from the instances of the eminent monarchies of the East,
Meroe, Thebes, Memphis, Babylon, Nineveh, Bagdad, and
Mosul. So, too, on the Indus and Ganges, in the domains
of Taxila, Maghada, Benares; and later in the great
empire, whose centers were Agra and Delhi. China has
arrived at its highest civilization in the fertile district between
its two greatest rivers. Greece and Rome are
marked exceptions. Their progress they owe, not to great
river basins, but to their peninsular form in the middle of
the coast of a delightful sea, full of islands and surrounded
by lands in a greater or less advanced state of civilization.
England’s peculiar maritime position has given it its wonderful
vantage-ground for progress in all human culture.</p>

<p>In the east of Europe, the basins of rivers have exercised
the same influence, to a certain extent, that has been
hinted at above; and Moscow, Kiev, Cracow, and Warsaw
remain the seats of a civilization which, rude as it was,
owed its existence to the physical conditions of the great
Sarmatian river systems. In western Europe, the less
marked features of the country have contributed to the
peculiar historical development of the continent. The
rich deltas have become the granaries for a large part of
the population, allowing industry to flow into other channels
besides agriculture. The sea-faring habits of the people
along the coast have broken up and done away with what
is special and provincial, and have conferred a cosmopolitan
manner of living upon the entire population. It was
the same with the Phenicians in ancient times, with the
Portuguese in the middle ages, as it has been with the
English, Spanish, and Dutch in modern days. Fishing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
navigation, and trade have become permanent necessities
of civilization. In the heart of continental Europe, the
rivers have had a great influence on the progress of nations;
the North German streams have extended their
effect from the abode of the ancient Saxons along the Baltic
as far as the home of the Salic Franks on the Scheldt,
Seine, and Loire; the Danube, with its complex and important
system of terraces and lowlands, has opened communication
between South Germany and Hungary, Wallachia,
and the East. The Vistula, Oder, Elbe, and Weser
have connected the homes of the old Sclavic population
with the Scandinavian coasts and the land of the Angles
and Saxons at the neck of Denmark, to the equal advantage
of both. The great terrace system of the Rhine,
embracing the Odenwald, Hardt, Spessart, Taunus, Hundsrück,
Eifel, and the Siebengebirg, has thrown into the most
active industrial and commercial relations the whole district
which it waters. It opened a way to the Romans
in their conquering advances before it did to the tribes of
Helvetia, Gallia, Germania, or the Lowlands: it sundered
those tribes, and kept them from preying upon each other;
but, in the advance of civilization, it has become one of
the strongest bands to knit together the central countries
of Europe.</p>

<p>The Danube, with its extensive terrace lands, faces the
east, and has, therefore, very different relations to European
history from the Rhine. It is a double-headed river,
and one of its head-streams, the one which bears the name
of the river proper, extends almost to the Rhine basin;
while the other, the Jura, has its source in Grisons, and
hard by the head-waters of the Rhine. As the Danube
connects the Caspian and Black Sea basin with western
Europe, and the largest part of the Asiatic immigrations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
have followed its course, the Danube has become the great
avenue between Europe and Asia. Celts, Teutons, and
Romans were mingled even before Christ, in Noricum,
Vindelecia, Bavaria, and Suabia. How many tribes may
have been crowded westward by these, is unknown to us.
The same fate has happened to the people who settled
there before Christ, and the inroads of the Huns, Goths,
and other tribes of similar origin, scattered the older inhabitants
over all Central Germany. We know, too, that
Sclavic, Hungarian, and Turkish incursions followed, each
one dispossessing wholly or in part the one which preceded
it.</p>

<p>All great rivers and river systems have had a similar
influence on the course of civilization. There is not a
single type feature in the world which has not contributed
its part to the advance of the human race; no one is without
its place and its function.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="heading37">The Configuration of the Continents.</h3>

<p>All the divisions of the earth, taken together in their
internal and external connections, in their mutual action
and reaction, constitute the unity of the globe, and make
apparent that it is a simple organism, designed and created
by divine skill, and intended to be the home of a race
whose culture should, in the course of centuries, unfold
from the most simple beginnings to the most complex and
elaborate perfection.</p>

<p>We have already seen that the surface of the earth is
naturally divided into three typical features—highland,
lowland, and the transition terraces between them. From
the vertical and horizontal combination of these result the
most of the geographical forms which are the subject of
our study. They form what we may, for convenience, call
the bas-relief of the globe.</p>

<p>At the creation of the earth every great continental
division received (as every other organism has, regarded
by itself, and not in relation to the greater whole of which
it forms a part) its own special form. Each continent
is like itself alone; its characteristics are not shared by
any other. Each one was so planned and so formed as to
have its own special function in the progress of human
culture. This may be seen by reviewing the history of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
the past; this may fairly be suspected yet to be in the
future. The individuality of each continent raises it to a
place where its characteristics give it an independent
character, and a capacity of development of itself, up to a
certain point, but never beyond it. The continents are
never to be regarded as high, dead masses of land, but as
vital and effective instruments, working upon each other
ceaselessly, and helping each other to attain the consummation
intended in the counsels of the Divine Mind. The
unity of the earth, the unity of the continents, the unity of
every physical feature of the continents, and the building
all up together in a perfect symmetry and mutual adaptation
of parts, is the crowning thought of Geographical
Science.</p>

<p>The study of first causes has no less clear illustrations
in the course of our investigations than elsewhere. It is
the task of science to show the nature and mutual relations
of all the subjects which fall within the scope of
Natural History. The nature of the parts is only understood
from a comprehension of the whole; not the reverse,
however. That is a most just saying of Plato. The
knowledge of the universal cannot proceed from a knowledge
of the special. As the part is formed only in view
of and on account of the whole, in its study, dissociated
from the whole, it becomes a mere unit and independent
existence. From understanding the solar system, we
might arrive at a knowledge of the motion of the earth;
and so, from a knowledge of the earth, we may advance
to its continents, their relations, the characteristics of the
different natural divisions, their subdivisions, their phenomena,
and their living organization, embracing man,
animals, and plants.</p>

<p>The external formation of the globe, or what we may call<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
the configuration of the continents, rests upon two characteristics—the
horizontal and vertical dimensions.</p>

<p>1. The horizontal dimensions are designated by the sea-line
boundary—the geographical limitation.</p>

<p>2. The vertical dimensions—the physical limitation—are
defined by the elevation of terraces and highlands, and
they exhibit the greatest diversity of phenomena.</p>

<p>The horizontal dimensions supply most of the material
for our elementary compends for political geography, which
seldom make much account of vertical dimensions, and
which, by no means, penetrate to their real value. They
are commonly held to be a side-matter, to be touched
lightly upon, or wholly cast aside. But both must be
thoroughly studied; for they are mutually dependent, and
are never found divorced in nature. In order to understand
them in their true relations, we will look at them in
their general aspect, discussing first the horizontal extent
of the continents, then their vertical elevation, so far as
that has not already been treated. After this twofold investigation,
the character of each continent and its subdivisions
will appear in its true light.</p>

<p>On account of the importance of thoroughly understanding
the articulation of great districts, in contradistinction
to a mere division, which implies no organic and living
correlation of parts, and which gives over to mathematics,
political history, and fortuitous circumstances the duty of
explaining geographical phenomena, it is instructive to
trace the footsteps of our science back to some of the
earlier conceptions.</p>

<p>Eratosthenes and Polybius were aware that the south
of Europe was a series of peninsulas, the first of the two
speaking of the great peninsulas of Spain, Italy, and the
Peloponnesus, the latter adding allusions to the smaller<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
Grecian peninsula of Sunium, the Thracian on the Bosporus,
and the Tauric Chersonesus, now known as the Crimea.
Strabo got a clearer insight into the significance
of these forms, (whose meaning Hipparchus had already
tried to explain,) by discussing them according to the sea
basins which they separate. Thus the Spanish peninsula
separates the Gulf of Cadiz, at the Pillars of Hercules,
from the Tyrrhene Sea; Italy separates the Sicilian Sea
from the Adriatic; the Peloponnesus separates the Adriatic
and the Euxine. This view, though apparently simple,
was really profound; for it hinted at the great significance
of the maritime coast in developing the civilization of those
countries. And Strabo goes on to add that Italy, with its
southeastern and southwestern extremities, becomes too
pointed, (δικόρυφος,) and that the eastern peninsulas of
Europe are much more jagged and articulated (ποικίλαι καὶ
πολύμερεῖς) than Polybius had conceived them to be. He
entered, therefore, upon a more minute subdivision. Strabo
had already (ii. 92) called the Peloponnesus “many-parted,”
(πολυ σχεδές,) as the Laconian peninsula (Tœnarum)
is separated from Malea, the Attic from Sunium,
and all southern Europe cannot, therefore, be laid out in
six parts. Of the north of Europe, Strabo was not in a
position to gain any accurate conception. Toward the
end of his second book, where he gives his reason for beginning
his description at the West, he uses the awkward
but significant phrase “polymorphous formation,” to indicate
the superiority which Europe enjoys in its complex
articulation over the other continents. The passage in
Strabo runs thus: “We begin with Europe, because it is
so intricately organized, and is the most favorable for
human culture, and has conferred upon the other continents
the most of the advantages which its position has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
secured for itself. It is habitable almost everywhere;
there is but a little portion of its territory too cold to be
the home of man, etc. It enjoys an admirable physical
conformation, for it is so perfectly harmonized in the
mingling of plains and mountains, (ὅλη γάρ διαπεποίκιλται
πεδίας τε και ὅρεδιν,) that the city and the country are
brought together, and the people educated by equally
favorable conditions to habits of great bravery. Europe
is, therefore, complete in herself, (ἀμταρκεστάτη ἐστί.)” By
this Strabo indicates the independent character of Europe,
and its equality with the other continents, despite its
smaller size.</p>

<p>Yet for long centuries this insight of that keen observer
into one of the most weighty of all the physical conditions
of the globe was almost wholly overlooked. At length,
however, Humboldt brought it out into new life in its
climatological relations, and showed that it is one of the
most important considerations to base a study of the distribution
of plants and animals upon, as well as for the
study of almost all kinds of physical phenomena. In his
very instructive paper on the most prominent reasons for
the variation in temperature on the globe, published in
1827, he uses the significant expression: “Our Europe is
indebted for its mild climate, to its position, and its articulated
form.” We have adhered to the same view, and
have expanded it in a paper<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> called The Geographical
Position and Horizontal Extension of the Continents, as
well as in all my lectures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<h3 id="heading38">The Superficial Dimensions and Articulation of the
Continents.</h3>

<p>We proceed from the more simple to the more complex
forms, and begin, therefore, with Africa, which has the
most uniform contour of all the continents.</p>

<p>Africa, the true South of the earth, is distinguished
from all the other great divisions of the earth by its almost
insular form and its unbroken outline. It is separated
from Asia merely by the Isthmus of Suez, scarcely
70 miles wide. But it is of altogether more virgin a nature
than Asia, and has been encroached upon by scarcely
any foreign influence. Africa is a unit in itself; the most
exclusive of continents, its periphery is almost a perfect
ellipse. With the exception of the single Gulf of Guinea
on the west side, the continent is a true oval. Its linear
dimensions are almost equal in length and breadth. It
extends about 35° on each side of the equator, and is
about 70° of longitude in width. The length and breadth
are both about 5000 miles.</p>

<p>The periphery of its coast is the most simple and unbroken
in the world. A single glance at the map is sufficient
to show this. Nowhere are there the deep arms of
the sea and the sinuous shores of other continents. The
Gulf of Guinea is all. The entire length of its coast-line
is but 16,000 or 17,000 miles, not much more than the
circumference of a circle whose diameter is 5000 miles.
Its coast-line, proportioned to its area, being the shortest
on the globe, gives Africa the least contact with the ocean
of all the continents, and subjects it to the least amount
of oceanic influences.</p>

<p>Thus all individualization of the various phases of life—vegetable,
animal, and human—is denied to this continent,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
whose extremities, on account of the equality of its dimensions,
lie equally far removed from the central point. The
similar size and configuration of the two lobes north and
south of the equator create no strong contrasts, and give
rise merely to tropical and sub-tropical conditions. All
the phenomena of this great division, the real South of the
earth, in which all the culminations of the tropical world
are found, are therefore more uniform than in any other
part of the world. The characteristics of race remain
in their primitive condition, and have made no progress
with the lapse of time: this region seems to be kept as
the refuge of a yet undeveloped future. Only general,
never individual and special development in the world of
plants, animals, nor man, appear upon this stationary soil;
the palm, the camel, and their natural companions appear
in equal numbers in the northern, southern, eastern, and
western extremities; the negro is almost exclusively the
only inhabitant of the continent. There is no striking individuality
apparent in the culture, stature, organization,
nor popular characteristics of its various parts. Even a
common foundation language gives rise to mere dialectical
differences. A mere sporadic coast-culture gives rise
to mere exceptions here and there, and these are generally
the result, not of inward progress, but of imported foreign
conditions.</p>

<p>Asia, the Orient, is wholly unlike Africa. On three
sides it is entirely sea-girt—the south, the east, and the
north; on the west only partly, about 1400 miles. On
the west, too, it is connected with Africa, but not in a
way to insure any necessary relations between the two
continents. But with Europe it stands in the most intimate
connection, forming a single body with it, of which
Europe is really but a great western peninsula. Europe,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
the Occident of the Old World, is therefore for less widely
severed from its Orient than from its real South or Africa.
The history of Asia and that of Europe are woven with a
twisted strand; they form a single thread, and their populations
are far more closely connected in physical and spiritual
organizations than are the people of Asia and Africa.</p>

<p>Asia, instead of being a simple oval, approaches the
trapezoidal form, and consequently enters into a new set
of relations resulting from its configuration. With the
deeply-penetrating gulfs and bays and seas which sink
into its trunk, the prominent peninsulas are in direct correspondence,
marking in an especial manner the eastern
and southern coast, but not lacking on the northern and
western. These peninsulas are to be regarded as the
limbs of a great central continental trunk. The eastern
ones are the Tchooktchee foreland, the peninsulas of Kamtchatka
and Corea, and the Chinese foreland. The southern
ones are the peninsula of Farther India, including
Tonquin, Siam, Malacca, and Birmah; the peninsulas of
Hindostan, or Deccan and Arabia. The western limb is
the peninsula of Asia Minor or Australia. The northeast
of Asia is less articulated; still it has a number of
arms pointing southward—the Sea of Kara, the Gulf of
Obi and Yenisei, for example. The whole Siberian coast
even is far more serrated than that of Africa, where it is
an almost unbroken line.</p>

<p>Still, there remains in the interior of Asia a broad and
long mass of the continent, which is penetrated by no seas.
It is to be regarded as the real trunk, and preponderates
immensely over the area of all the confined projections.
Asia is, therefore, a trunk with profuse richness of articulation.
Africa is a trunk without articulation: a mere
compact continental mass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>The immense influence which so complex a coast form
has upon all physical phenomena and on all organic life
is evident. Far greater results must come from the mutual
influence of sea and land than from unbroken land;
far more numerous influences upon the climate, and upon
plants, animals, and man. Even the changing geological
structure of the coast-line must have an effect, when blending
with all these other influences, greater than it would
have in the interior. Every part of the coast has become
different from every other part, with a different hydrographic
and climatic character; and the great increase of
races of men, and species of plants and animals, was a
natural result. While Africa remained limited in all its
relations, and destitute of any richness of variety, Asia
has always enjoyed an amazing fertility of resources. Instead
of the three races or species of man found in Africa—Negro,
Berber, and Caffre—many are met in Asia, all
different, Tchooktchees, Kamtchadales, Coreans, Chinese,
Malays, Bermese, Hindoos, Afghans, Persians, Arabs, and
Armenians. And these belong merely to the coast-line.</p>

<p>But the contrast of the great central region to the
broken coast is so great and complete, that the advanced
culture along the sea-line has not penetrated far into the
interior, nor changed the habits of the nomadic tribes
which fill Central Asia, and whose representatives we
have in the Mongolians, Toorkomans, Kirgheez, Bukharians,
Calmucks, etc. Still less could it reach the distant
north, to which, with all the splendor which we associate
with everything oriental, the civilization of the southern
coasts is utterly wanting. To this element of superficial
size, the immense and almost insuperable obstacles which
Nature has placed so thickly in Asia may be added, and
also the immense variety of natural productions which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
climates so different as those of the different parts of the
continent exhibit. Extending from the equator to the
north frigid zone, Asia affords a home for the most diversified
kinds of plants and animals, and shows, too,
hardly less variety in its eastern and western extremes
than in its northern and southern. The characteristics
of the Chinese flora and fauna are very widely different
from those of Hither Asia. In the east, we have the sago-tree
and the tiger; in the west, the date-palm and the
lion. The north gives us moss, the coniferæ, and the
reindeer, in contrast with the bread-fruit tree, the sugar-cane,
the broad-leaved banana, the elephant, rhinoceros,
tapir, and monkey of the south.</p>

<p>The inexhaustibleness of the Asiatic continent is not
more visible in all this wealth of productivity than in the
abundance as well as the variety of human life. Though
Asia has been the mother of the world, and has sent out
so many and so eminent races, it has not been to the depletion
of the parent country. In race, figure, color,
manner of life, nationality, religion, political and social
bonds of union, forms of government, culture, language,
it is so richly diversified, that no continent, viewed historically,
can be compared to it. Asia seems to have been
created to send forth its fruitful scions of life to all the
other great divisions of the earth.</p>

<p>Europe, the Occident. The smallest of the three continents
of the Old World, its superficial contents are the
largest in proportion to the amount of coast-line. Only
on the east side has it a land frontier; and there it has
its widest extent from north to south. Like Asia, it is
bordered on three sides by the ocean. Asia seems like a
mighty trunk, at whose western extremity the broken and
serrated Occident is found, advancing in breadth from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
north to south, but articulating into arms of various size
from east to west, till it loses itself in the peninsulas of
the Atlantic coast. The nearer to Asia, the broader is Europe,
and the more akin to the Asiatic character; the farther
from it, the more minute become its subdivisions, and
the more varied its character.</p>

<p>Taken in a general way, the proportion of the truly
continental part of Europe to the maritime districts is
much less than is the case in Asia. Its contrast with
Africa is, of course, yet more striking.</p>

<p>Europe begins at the east, at the foot of the Ural and
Caucasus, and at the steppes of West Asia. It does not
take, as Asia and Africa do, (which are alike in this,) a
trapezoidal or oval form, but in its linear dimensions there
is a great difference between its length and breadth. By
the diminution of its width, as we go westward, and by
the increase of its articulation, the number of its internal
relations increases toward the Atlantic. A great falling
off in the oriental character which has largely encroached
upon Russia, and a constant increase of an independent
spirit, is the sure result of natural conditions, and is experienced
in all life and in things material as well as intellectual
and moral. The configuration here wins a
palpable victory over mere quantity, and the exceedingly
varied coast gives to all European institutions their distinctive
character.</p>

<p>Beginning with a breadth of about 1400 miles at the
east, the continent gradually diminishes in width to
1000, 500, and even to 250 miles. Its first narrowing is
visible between the Gulf of Riga and the Bay of Odessa;
the next is between the Baltic and the Gulf of Trieste;
the next, between the Zuider-Zee and the Gulf of Genoa;
the next, between the English Channel at Calais and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
Gulf of Lyons; and the last, between Bayonne and Perpignan.</p>

<p>With almost three times as great a length as breadth,
Europe extends for a distance of over 300 miles from the
southern part of the Ural chain and from the Caucasus
to the extremities of the bold coast of Spain and Portugal,
Capes Finistère and St. Vincent. In this way the
continent assumes very nearly the form of a right-angled
triangle, the right angle lying at the Caspian, the base
extending westward to Cape Finistère, the perpendicular
running northward along the Ural Mountains to the Vaigats
Straits, and the hypothenuse connecting the two
extremities. The area embraced within this triangle
would be not far from 2,200,000 square miles. Such a
triangle, however, is not exact,—it is but an approximation
to mathematical precision; but it is clearly enough
marked to be traced upon our map, or, as a spherical triangle,
upon our globes. All geographical forms have only
a more or less remote approach to mathematical exactness,
but enough to aid us very much in representing them
and showing their relations.</p>

<p>Almost all the greater and really important extremities
of the continent lie outside of the triangle above indicated;
and this method of treatment only serves to call attention to
the great central mass, which would otherwise be in danger
of being overlooked, in view of the immense value and
influence of the countries on the coast and beyond the triangular
line of demarkation. It needs but a glance to see
how the projecting shores have marred all the theoretical
precision of such a line.</p>

<p>The coast-line shows itself directly subject to almost
boundless diversity. Toward the west the independence
of each peninsula increases, the more evidently and prominently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
according to its distance from Asia. Not articulated
on two sides alone, like Asia, the east and south, but on
all three of its sides exposed to the ocean, the broken
coast-line is universal in Europe,—even toward the colder
north, where its peninsulas and adjacent islands almost
inclose two seas, the North and the Baltic. The advantage
which this gives to Europe over Asia in respect to the
development of its more northern regions, is very great
and evident.</p>

<p>We will enumerate the leading peninsulas of Europe:</p>

<p>Kola, on the White Sea, between Lake Enara, the Varanger
Fiord, and the Bay of Kandalaska, pointing westward.</p>

<p>Scandinavia, embracing Norway and Sweden, with
an area of more than 350,000 square miles, a tenth
of all Europe, connected with the main land by the isthmus
of Finland, but otherwise girded in a great bow by
the Atlantic, the North Sea, the Baltic, and the Gulf of
Bothnia, and pointing southward.</p>

<p>Jutland or Denmark, beginning at the Elbe and the
Trave and running north, embracing about ¹⁄₁₆₀ of Europe,
between the North Sea and the Baltic, low and flat.</p>

<p>The subdivided peninsula of Holland, between the
Rhine and the Ems, a flat plain, looking to the north.</p>

<p>The peninsula of Normandy and Brittany, between the
Seine and the Loire, a rocky granite formation, jutting
out into the Atlantic and faced by bold precipices.</p>

<p>Spain and Portugal, embracing about 220,000 square
miles, about ¹⁄₁₆ of Europe, rhomboidal in shape, almost
insular in position, turned southwesterly, its surface a
series of constantly rising terraces.</p>

<p>Italy, embracing ¹⁄₃₅ of Europe, between the Alps and
Sicily, and traversed by a mountain range.</p>

<p>Turkey and Greece, or summing it more strictly under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
one word, the Grecian peninsula, between the Danube
and the Morea, a most minutely divided region of plateaus
and mountain chains; in truth, the most articulated peninsula
in the world, and embracing ¹⁄₁₅ of Europe.</p>

<p>The Crimea, a rhomboidal peninsula, turned to the
south—its northern half a flat steppe, its southern a high
plateau—the only peninsula of southeastern Europe projecting
into the Black Sea.</p>

<p>Every one of these peninsulas differs from every other
in shape; every one has a distinct individuality imposed
upon it. Within the smallest compass on earth, relatively
speaking, there is found around Europe the very largest
variety in its articulations. The Grecian peninsula finds
its only superior on the northwest of Europe, in the coast
of insulated England.</p>

<p>By means of this characteristic separation of so many
more or less individualized parts of the continent through
the agency of arms of the sea, the coast-line of Europe
has been prolonged to an extraordinary length. The areas
of the three continents of the Old World are as follows
in round numbers: Europe, 3,500,000 square miles;
Africa, 11,800,000 square miles; and Asia, 19,300,000
square miles. Although the superficial contents of Africa
are three times that of Europe, the length of the coast-line
is so far from being equal, that that of Europe is much
the greater, being 25,400 miles. The Asiatic coast-line
is about one-third longer still, 32,900 miles; but, as the
area of Asia is more than five times that of Europe, a
great part of the Asiatic coast-line, that on the north,
from Nova Zembla to Kamtchatka, must be considered as
unimportant in relation to the development of the resources
of Asia.</p>

<p>Europe is, therefore, that continent of the Old World<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
which has relatively, and I might almost say absolutely,
received the largest coast-line of any, encompassing a distance
of 25,400 miles. That is to say, the coast-line of
Europe, extended in a straight line, would pass around
the globe and coincide with the equator. To this admirable
feature may be added its favorable relation in situation
to the various oceanic and wind currents, and its magnificent
supply of harbors, the result of its articulated
coast, all of which have made Europe the mistress of the
seas. Within modern times, the island group of Great
Britain and Ireland, the richest in harbors, is to the continent
what, in ancient times, the Greek peninsula was,
with its wealth of inlets, which gave it the command of
the Mediterranean. A rich gift this has been to the
smallest of the continents of the Old World, to equalize
its condition with others. The providential wisdom
which “sets one thing over against another,” is clearly
manifest in this. Europe, though in the center of the
great continental land-mass, becomes the most maritime
of all, the most approachable of all; or, in other words,
its countries and its peoples are the most closely connected
with the sea of all in the Old World, because they stand in
the most unbroken contact with it.</p>

<p>Thus we discover the characteristic type which was
impressed on Europe from the very first. Its relation to
the world could not be understood by the ancients, as to
them half of the earth lay in unbroken darkness. Only
by experience, only by the advance of civilization, and by
comparison with all the other continents, could this insight
be gained. Doubtless many similar relations yet
remain unknown and unsuspected, which will some day
come to the light. The earth, as a planet, is only a grain
of seed-corn sown by the Creator, enriched with powers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
of unfolding to infinite perfection in the unexplored future.
What we now perceive are only the elementary principles—our
knowledge only a motley; but even this is not
without its uses, and is worthy of patient mastery.</p>

<p>Europe, so broken in its coast, and rifted far toward its
center by arms of the sea, has been affected in all its civil
and social history to a very great extent. This is the
first natural condition of its progress, the true physical
basis of the fact that, upon the most limited of the continents,
the greatest historical diversity has sprung up. It
is not absolute size, but relative, which gives the pre-eminence;
not the raw material, the mere mass, but its articulation,
its form, which here, as everywhere, gives mind
the mastery over matter. As in the animal and vegetable
world there is, amid all the diversity of forms, a constant
advance from a lower to a higher plane, manifesting itself
in the complexity of the organs; so, in the so-called unorganized
side of nature, we see the same characteristic as
soon as we have grasped the whole mutual system of
adaptations. The most general study of the differences
between the continents exhibits an analogous harmony
and correlation. As the simple, broad-leaved, solid cactus,
or bunch-trunked euphorbia, (peculiar to the dry sand
steppes of America and Africa,) appear branchless and
without foliage,—the lower and undeveloped forms of
vegetation,—so, too, the regions to which they are indigenous
are the unbroken plains of North America, or the
plateaus of still less broken Africa.</p>

<p>The broken coast-line of Asia and Europe is analogous
to that higher development which we find in the palm and
in the full, round crown of the European fruit-tree, which
bears blossoms and fruit as far as the very extremities of
the branches. In the animal organization, the articulation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
of Europe is to be compared with the complex hand of
man, so far superior to the prehensile organs of lower
creatures, that Buffon saw in that feature alone the manifestation
of man’s place among the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>If we look out over the earth, we see that the limbs of
the continents, so to speak, the coasts, the peninsulas, and
the adjacent islands, are the most favored places of all for
civilization to find its true home upon. With the degree
of diversity in the structure of a country, the value of its
organisms advances. In this respect, Europe may be considered
as the branches and foliage of a great tree, whose
trunk and root are to be traced to Central Asia, Africa
being a stunted side-shoot. Or, to compare the continents
to a still higher class of forms, Europe may be called the
Face of the Old World, out of which the soul of humanity
could look more clearly into the great and promising future.</p>

<p>We repeat it—it is not absolute size, it is not the mass
nor the weight of the material, it is the form, in its greater
complexity, which determines the fate of nations and decrees
the advancement of man. This gift, in its full measure,
has been conferred on Europe. In its complex articulation
lies still another characteristic of Europe in
contradistinction to the other continents.</p>

<p>If in Africa the coast offers no contrast to the interior,
and both remain on the same low plane of development,
Asia, on the contrary, displays a perfect antagonism between
its central regions and its sea-board. The territory
of the Mongolians, the Tartars, and Toorkomans has always
remained at the very lowest stage of civilization. The sea-board,
on the other hand, has witnessed the growth of a
number of isolated nations, who, without the help of
mutual dependence, have arrived at a considerably high<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
degree of culture—the Chinese, Malays, Hindoos, Persians,
Arabians, Syrians, and Armenians. But their influence
could not penetrate to the compact interior, to
transform its nature, nor modify its nationalities. Individual
progress in nations, however high it may be carried,
can never contribute much toward any real penetration of
the interior of so vast a region as Central Asia.</p>

<p>Europe shows in its construction and the relations to
which it gives rise characteristics exactly opposite. Being
far less massive, the proportion of its extremities to the
undeveloped interior is much less great than in Asia.
From this, it results that the central part does not prove
a hinderance to civilization, viewed physically, hydrographically,
or historically; it nowhere serves as a barrier,
but rather as a mediator, and a means of communication
between the extremities. This has given Europe a character
exactly opposite to that of Asia: its North and its
South are united, its East and its West; they are not like
antagonistic poles, but extend to each other friendly hands.
In Africa, the greater part of the interior lies absolutely
without contact with and relations to the coast. In Asia,
there is a much larger portion of the interior equally without
connection with the sea-board, and remaining up to
this day in its primitive barbarism.</p>

<p>Symmetry of form gains in Europe a clear advantage
over mere mass. Europe, the smallest of the continents,
was destined to gain precedence over all the rest, Asia included.
As Asia, lying within all the zones, colossal in size,
and most plentifully enriched with the gifts of nature, was
fitted to be the nursery of supply for all other parts of the
world without impoverishing itself; so Europe, limited
in size and confined to the temperate zone, but most complex
in its subdivision, having a great diversity in its ocean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
inlets, as well as in its hills, valleys, plateaus, and mountains,
yet, without great extremes, has been especially
fitted for the reception of stranger races, and for the
development of their energies and the advance of their
culture. The symmetry and harmony of Europe have
constituted the true home of all varieties of national
character, and have adapted it to their mutual action,
and to the transfer of their distinctive character to one
another.</p>

<p>Throughout the entire center of Europe there is an intimate
connection with the sea-coast and with the extremities,
with the least possible disadvantages. This is accomplished
by those sinuous river-courses whose analogies
are to be found nowhere in the adjacent continents. The
very broadest part of Russia even is intersected with large
navigable rivers; and the west and center of Europe are
not less richly supplied with these lines of communication,
whose starting-points lie often close together, as in the case
of the Danube, the Rhine, the Po, and the Rhone. How
different is this from the hydrographical system of Central
Asia, where the sources of the eastern rivers lie thousands
of miles removed from those of the western rivers, and
where the rivers of the north are separated by almost as
great distances from those of the south!</p>

<p>To what nature has given to Europe man has largely
added, seeking by means of canals and railways to make
the whole continent subject to him and auxiliary to his
needs. In this way the interior districts have appropriated
to themselves the advantages of the sea-coast,
and the distance which it has placed between itself and
Asia and Africa has only been increased. Nature first
gave Europe its vantage-ground, and man has gone on
from that point and doubled the gifts of nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>Great peninsulas stretch away into both the great inland
seas of Europe—that of the North and that of the
South; the Danish and Scandinavian peninsulas into the
complex, and yet, physically speaking, single body of
water, embracing the North Sea, Baltic, and Gulf of Bothnia;
Spain, Italy, and the Grecian peninsula extending
southward into the Mediterranean. In the latter there is
the greatest contrast between the deeply-indented northern
shore and the bare, sandy coast of the African side. In
just as great contrast is the uniformly unbroken sea-line
of northern Siberia, compared with the articulated shore
of northern Russia. How entirely different would the
development of northern Asia have been, if a Siberian inland
sea had penetrated to the very foot of the Altai, as
the seas of northern Europe have pierced to the center of
the continent! And had the shallow Syrtis cleft northern
Africa as far as Lake Tchad, as the Adriatic has done
on the opposite coast, Central Africa would not now be a
terra incognita.</p>

<p>The northern as well as the southern extremities of Europe,
so far as they are projected into inland seas, have received
an equal size and equal natural advantages, each of its
own kind, so that, conditioned by its own peculiarities, its
population have helped it to attain its rightful place, and
an individuality independent of continental influences.
The abundant resources which each of these extremities
enjoys have insured it, in a physical as well as historical
view, an independence which has reacted favorably
upon the whole continent. What a debt does not Europe
owe to the Greeks, Italians, Spaniards, Dutch, Danes,
Scandinavians! How entirely different would the whole
development of the shores of Europe have been, had they
been bold, inaccessible rocks, an unbroken line of coast,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
like Uralaska, or the smaller Asiatic peninsulas of Kamtchatka
and Malacca! And where would the accomplished
European stand to-day, in comparison with his black
neighbor on the south, were it not for the articulated
coast-line of the continent which gives him his home?</p>

<p>And still there remains, out of the inexhaustible richness
of nature, one leading feature to be taken into account.
To estimate it properly, we must pay attention
briefly to the islands of the three continents of the Old
World.</p>

<h3 id="heading39">Islands.</h3>

<p>Europe, as a continent, is distinguished by its adjacent
islands. Following the irregular coast-line of its many
extremities, they lie along, in greater or less number, the
satellites, so to speak, of the main land. They are scattered
almost everywhere, yet not distant from the coast, like
Iceland, but within sight of the shore. In character they
resemble the adjacent coast, and form a true part of the
main land, except in the one fact of separation. Strabo
even called Sicily an insular continuation of Italy, and
discriminated between islands found in mid-ocean and
those found near the coast, calling the former pelagic and
the latter littoral islands. These he regarded as having
been at some previous period rent from the main land.
The coast islands are by no means, like many of the pelagic
islands, mere rocky groups, thrown up by volcanic convulsions,
or small, desolate, barren ledges. They are very diverse
in character: some are fertile single islands, like
Sicily, Candia, Bornholm, Rugen, Negropont; some are
double islands, like Britain and Ireland, Zealand and
Funen, Corsica and Sardinia; some are island groups,
like the 3 Balearic islands, the 3 Maltese islands, the 20
Ionian islands, the 67 Orkneys, the 90 Shetlands, the still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
more numerous Hebrides, the Aland group, and that of
the Grecian archipelago. They are generally of very large
size, in comparison with the continent to which they are
adjacent; a characteristic not only very rare in islands,
but which must exert great influence. They are to be
viewed, therefore, as continuations of Europe, not as lands
sundered from the main land; they are to be considered as
its sea-ports, and the mediators between Europe and the
other continents.</p>

<p>In round numbers, the islands of Europe embrace about
175,000 square miles—a twentieth of the continent.</p>

<p>This amount of insular territory has given Europe a
great diversity of relations, and has contributed much to
its ethnographical character. Imagine only England and
her whole group struck out of existence. What impoverishment
it would bring! The Danish peninsula, without
the adjacent islands of Funen and Zealand, were a mere
tongue of sand. Without Sicily to furnish grain, Rome’s
history had been entirely different from what it was. What
a change it would have made in the development of Italy
and Greece, had the Cyclades and Crete not served as a
bridge, over which the civilization of Hither Asia might
pass! Yet these islands, with their inhabitants, do not
stand in necessary dependence on the contiguous main
land; they have often in themselves the conditions of independent
growth and prosperity. And yet the geological
qualities and general features of islands may agree
very closely with those of the land hard by; as is the case
with the British, Danish, Italian, and Grecian groups.
Southern England is a continuation of northern France,
Picardy, and the Netherlands, as the geology of these
districts shows. Sicily is a continuation of the volcanic
soil of Calabria, and Candia of the Morea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>Hence the possibility, despite the separation of islands
from the main land, of a close connection in the habits,
manners, and culture of the people, thus separated, depending
as they do on a common soil, and having the
same industries in common. It would be entirely different
in Great Britain, for example, if the south end of
England were geologically formed like the north end of
Scotland. Instead of harmony there would be repulsion,
and that mutual interchange of relations would not exist
which has so powerful an influence on the whole course
of European history.</p>

<p>The remarkable number of islands on the coast of Europe,
and their significance and value, formerly escaped
attention; or rather their influence on the development of
that continent, in comparison with others, was not made a
matter of study.</p>

<p>Africa has never enlarged its domain through the aid
of adjacent islands. Poor as it is in all coast indentations,
it is just as poor in islands. Only a few insignificant ones,
which have no close geological connection with the shore,
are found here. The sporadic groups found in the Atlantic
and Indian Oceans are almost exclusively the product
of subterranean forces, and are entirely unlike the stratified
lime and sandstone formations of the coast. There is,
therefore, no close connection between the inanimate nature
of continent and islands and their respective populations;
no physical conditions have imposed upon them a
common historical development. Only the Canary Islands,
southwest of the Atlas Mountain range, and Madagascar,
could be regarded as at all exceptional to this. But the
nine Canaries are relatively extremely small, embracing
but about 3000 square miles in all; much too small to exercise
any important influence, or to harbor a large population.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
Besides, they are separated from the main land
by marine currents, which would prevent any very important
reaction, however large the islands in themselves might
be. The Cape Verd islands, embracing only about 1750
square miles, stand in yet more unfavorable relations to
the main land. So, too, the solitary islands of St. Helena
and Ascension, and in the Indian Ocean the scattered
groups of the Camara, Amirante, and Seychelle islands,
embracing all together but 3300 square miles, and Socotra,
about 1750 square miles. Only Madagascar would
be large enough to enrich the continent essentially, if it
were nearer to the main land. But it is separated from it
by the broad and dangerous Mozambique Channel; both,
therefore, have remained without mutual relations; their
populations are entirely unlike, and there has been no exchange
of productions between them. Madagascar is,
therefore, only apparently, and by the apparent contiguity
of the mass, a neighbor of Africa; but, in reality, <i>i.e.</i> as
it relates to the organic unity of all the various parts of
the globe, it is far more intimately connected by the system
of marine currents to the Malayan Archipelago, southeast
of Asia, than to Africa.</p>

<p>Entirely different is it with the island system of Asia.
The eastern and southern sides are remarkably characterized
by the profuse numbers of islands found there. It
might be said, that what Africa lacks in this regard, Asia
more than supplies. On the Asiatic coast they appear in
such vast numbers that they have been called, in contrast
with the Old and New Worlds, the Island World, or Polynesia.
They appear under the most varied conditions—in
long rows, in massive groups, and here and there singly.
They begin with the North Polar islands, and pass southward
in unbroken succession past the equator as far as
the tropic of Capricorn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>The Aliaska chain connects the northwest coast of
America with Kamtchatka; it comprises over 100 islands,
and embraces about 7660 square miles.</p>

<p>The Koorile island extends to the south as far as Saghalien
and Yesso.</p>

<p>The Japanese chain runs southward as far as Cape
Corea, and includes the great island of Niphon with
numerous smaller ones, embracing an area of 164,000
square miles.</p>

<p>Then follow:—</p>

<p>The Loo-Choo islands as far as Formosa.</p>

<p>The single island of Formosa, 13,000 square miles.</p>

<p>The coast island of Hainan, 16,450 square miles.</p>

<p>The numerous group of the Philippines, with the adjacent
islands, 121,000 square miles.</p>

<p>The greater Sunda group, with its adjoining archipelago,
689,500 square miles. Of these, Borneo embraces
295,600 square miles; Sumatra, 167,700 square miles;
Java, 54,600 square miles; and Celebes, 72,600 square
miles.</p>

<p>The smaller Sunda group, 29,200 square miles.</p>

<p>The scattered group of the Moluccas, with the Banda
and Ternate islands, 7950 square miles.</p>

<p>The great island of New Guinea, 262,800 square miles,
which forms the transition of the Australian group.</p>

<p>On the south coast of Deccan, the great island of Ceylon,
25,860 square miles.</p>

<p>These rows and groups of islands, embracing an aggregate
of 1,095,000 square miles, form a kind of insular
isthmus from the southeastern extremity of Asia to the
northwest of Australia, though broken by unnumbered
straits. If lines be drawn from Sumatra and from
Hainan to Cape York, on the north coast of Australia, an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
ideal isthmus would be formed not unlike that which connects
North and South America. If this insular isthmus
be further conceived to have been thrown up by volcanic
forces, as that of Panama seems to have been, an addition
of 1,095,000 square miles has been made in this way to
the most productive portions of the world. So great is
the accession of territory that it has become the abode of
a distinct race—the Malay—which hardly finds a home
at all on the Asiatic shore. Asia has received very little
advantage from this vast archipelago. Only the southeast
coast has been affected by it; the continent, as a
whole, has not been reached by its influence. On the
contrary, Australia has been largely affected by it in its
productive and ethnographical character. Not only was
it first discovered through the agency of these islands, but
it probably derives its population from them; it has received
many of its animals and plants from them—the
sugar-cane, the sago palm, the bread-fruit tree, the dog,
and the swine.</p>

<p>In Polynesia, which, in point of size, far surpasses the
Antilles group north of South America, we have the most
dismembered region on the surface of the globe. It is the
highest degree of insulation, of individualization, and results
from the extreme carrying out of dispersing causes.
The space occupied by the greater Sunda group, with its
five seas—the China, Java, Molucca, Celebes, and Mindoro—together
with the islands adjacent, the whole lying between
longitude 110° and 160° east and latitude 10° south
and 20° north, a tract 3525 miles long and 2115 miles wide
may worthily be compared with the area of Europe. Such
a mass of island groups and single isles, belonging not to
Asia with any strict right, but in truth a maritime world
of itself, having but the slightest connections with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
adjacent continent, is not to be compared with the island
system of Europe, which is bound to the main land by
the closest ties.</p>

<p>Were a similar insular dismemberment the universal
principle on which the world is constructed, and were
there no continents whatever, there would be an entire
want of direct dependence in nations upon each other,
and a degree of independence which would be fatal to the
best interests of man. Europe would be broken up into
a number of great islands, like Borneo, and into countless
islets. In the conformation of Europe, however, there is
the happiest system of compensations, and the most harmonious
play of contrasts to be found in the world. The
disadvantages of a too great dividing up into islands, as in
Polynesia, and of too compact and unrifted a central mass,
as in Africa, are alike shunned. Both extremes could not
fail to be injurious to the best interests of the population.
The fullness and richness of nature might, perhaps, be increased;
but the effects on human life could not fail to
be bad. Man’s highest development does not consist
with any extreme in the natural world: it is linked to the
action and reaction of contrasts. In Polynesia, the district
of extreme dismemberment, the Malays are the least
homogeneous of any race on the earth. Malays, Battahs,
Dakkas, Horasuras, and Papuas are all engaged in destructive
war on each other, and are among the most degraded
peoples on the globe. In this region there is the
greatest diversity in physical nature, but not in the essential
characteristics of man. One point of accord ought
not to be passed by: there, where the forces of nature,
maritime and volcanic, are on the greatest scale known,
the warlike passions of man are on a not less consuming
scale. In Polynesia there are the rankest vegetation, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
most fervid heat, the most costly spices, animals very large
and rare; but man attains to no such superiority,—he degenerates
in worth and takes a low place. Where the
three natural kingdoms attain their perfection, man seems
to linger in the rear.</p>

<p>In Africa, where there is perfect uniformity in nature,
there is uniformity in man; and the negro stock, though
prolific, gives no race of high development to the world.
Both extremes are equally unfavorable to the advance of
man; he must have, in order to expand and take the place
to which his possibilities lead him, a sphere of mutual
conditions, to which a compact continent like Africa and
Central Asia can lay no claim, and at the same time be
free from that extreme individualization characteristic of
the islands of Polynesia.</p>

<p>Europe lies between these extremes. Limited in area,
diversified in surface, and deeply indented in its coast-line,
it has experienced all the advantages which a continent
needs for its development, and for that historical greatness
which Europe has won for itself. Less striking in natural
scenery and comparatively poor in resources, its contrasts
in respect mainly to the action of its inland seas
and rivers over the main land have conduced to the happiest
results. It has become the school for the Old and
the New World, taking the vitality and the crude gifts of
Asia and turning them into channels where they could
issue in new forms for the advancement and the humanizing
of the race.</p>

<h3 id="heading40">The Results of the above Considerations briefly stated.</h3>

<p>It will be seen, from what has now been said, that, with
an area three times less than that of Africa, Europe (including
its adjacent islands) has a coast-line twice as extended.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
Without the islands, it is 25,380 miles in length,
or the circumference of the earth. The coast-line of Africa
extends 17,860 miles; that of Asia 32,900.</p>

<p>The exceedingly varying areas of the continents may
now be passed in very speedy review. Europe is but a
fifth as large as Asia. It is somewhat more than a quarter
as large as Africa; it is almost of the same size with
Australia. In relation to America, it stands between Asia
and Africa; it makes about ¹⁄₁₅ of all the continents, and
about ¹⁄₂₀ of all the land surface of the globe; but it is
not absolute size, but relative, which determines the importance
of a continent; and this twentieth part of all
the land on the globe has had paramount influence over
all the rest within the past few centuries. The ethnographical
character of its population has had great weight
in securing this result, and other reasons will doubtless
be more apparent in the future.</p>

<p>One of the most important features in the study of the
relative importance of the continents is the comparative
relation of the main trunk, articulation, and island system
to each other. The following table presents this relation
as it exists in the Old World:—</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Africa:</td>
    <td>trunk</td>
    <td>1,</td>
    <td>extremities</td>
    <td>0,</td>
    <td>islands</td>
    <td>¹⁄₅₀</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Asia:</td>
    <td><span class="ditto">”</span></td>
    <td>4,</td>
    <td><span class="ditto">”</span></td>

    <td>1,</td>
    <td><span class="ditto">”</span></td>
    <td>¹⁄₂₀</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>These are but approximations to the exact mathematical
statement; but they serve to indicate comprehensively
this important fact. No exact canon now exists for the
perfect expression of the relations of the continents to
each other, and their physical superiority and inferiority,
and its lack is no less felt than it has been in art to express
the comparative importance of the organs of the human
body in giving a representation of man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<h3 id="heading41">The New World.</h3>

<p>America is broken by the Caribbean Sea into a double
continent, both parts being of colossal magnitude, although
the southern portion is about 2,000,000 square miles
less in area than the northern. North America contains
9,055,146 square miles. South America contains
7,073,875 square miles; and both contain 16,129,021.
The connecting link is found in the tapering isthmus of
Central America, with its 302,443 square miles of surface.</p>

<p>But closely connected as is the northern part of the
continent with the southern, in a physical sense, in real
connection, so far as man is concerned, they are widely
separated. During the three centuries which have elapsed
since the discovery of America, the Spanish and the Americans
have thought of breaking the connection—of sundering
the isthmus. All communication between North
and South America takes place by water, absolutely none
by land. Even before the navigation of the historical
period, there seems to have been no land road opened
along the isthmus. The old race of the Caribs passed in
boats from the Appalachian mountain land of North America
to South America and the West Indies. The Toltecs
and Aztecs—the oldest tribes which wandered southward—seemed
to have ended their march on the high plateau
of Mexico and the vale of Anahuac. The legends of the
Incas give us no tidings of their traversing the isthmus
and reaching Peru on foot, and it is probable that they
reached that land otherwise. The isthmus seems never
to have been a bridge, but always a barrier. The great
Antilles group of islands appears to have served far more
as a means of communication between North and South
America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>In respect of contour, both divisions have an unmistakable
analogy, which appears at first view. Both exhibit
a triangular form, with the base at the north and the
apex at the south. Toward the south, too, rather than
toward the west, speaking in general terms, the gradual
conquests of man advance, and therefore there cannot be
in the New World, as in the Old, a striking contrast between
the Orient and the Occident. East and west, in the
New World, are less dependent on each other; they have
more individuality, but with a great preponderance of
importance in the east over the west side, by reason of
the more favorable situation in relation to the sea, less
sharpness and boldness of physical features, and a more
scanty population. The west side of America has by no
means kept up with the advance of its eastern side. Nor
could the more southern shores of America compete with
those on the northeast, and supply an analogy to the occident
of the Old World; for North America stands related
to Europe by ties of the closest nature, by wind systems,
currents, a not dissimilar climate, and is far more nearly
connected with it than with South America: nor could
the latter derive any real advantage from its opposite
neighbor, rude and undeveloped Africa; nor has the Caribbean
Sea performed any such service for America as
the Mediterranean has for Europe, being twice as large in
area and far more unfavorably situated to advance the interests
of civilization. It is only within a recent period
that the Caribbean has become a valuable auxiliary to the
culture of the world.</p>

<p>South America is only a colossal right-angled triangle
of land, with very little articulation in its shores. The
northwest and the eastern angles are sharply defined, and
the southern one is very acute, the continent running out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
in the shape of a thin wedge. With some modifications,
it has the same form with its neighbor Africa, and is just
as unvarying in its want of a serrated coast, its sea-line
being but 16,000 miles in length, almost the same as that
of Africa. Like Africa, too, South America is destitute
of peninsulas and adjacent islands; its coast is as unindented
as that of Africa and Australia, all three of these
continents of the southern hemisphere being in strict conformity.
Yet South America is capable of great progress:
its conditions are very plastic; it is characterized by the
size and number of the great rivers which pass through
its very center; its flora and fauna are extremely rich. In
the fruitfulness of its soil, its division by mountains, and
its water system, it holds great pre-eminence over Africa.
An effort to connect its great rivers, and thus to make its
immense natural advantages of mutual service, seems to
promise a far more prosperous future for South America
than can be predicted for Central Africa; yet the native
population of the country stand on a very low plane of
manhood.</p>

<p>The wedge-shaped plateau of Patagonia is not at all
benefited, as previous analysis would lead us to expect, by
its long coast and by the nearness of the islands of Terra
del Fuego. The fruitful island of Tasmania is far more
valuable to Australia than is this island to Patagonia,
and even Iceland is a more productive neighbor to Norway.
The Terra del Fuego group, embracing a territory
of 29,000 square miles, although hard by the South American
coast, only injures it instead of blessing it, for it
imperils shipping and harbors a population so degraded
that they have no wants which can stimulate the rudest
civilization. With a precipitous, craggy coast, without
trees and without grass, covered only with moss, and belonging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
strictly to the polar world, it must give a habitation
to the very lowest and most degraded of the human
race, isolated from the world, and only casually visited
when winds and storms throw mariners upon its shores.</p>

<p>Not every island is to be considered, therefore, as a
gain to the adjacent main land. If Terra del Fuego lay
at the mouth of the La Plata River, it would have become
a valuable auxiliary to Brazil. The worth of an island
is relative, not absolute.</p>

<p>The Antilles group is the great insular formation contiguous
to Central America. Its area, though comprising
94,700 square miles, is not one-tenth as great as that of
the great Sunda group. By situation and physical conditions,
it is much more closely connected with North than
with South America. The Caribbean Sea is twice as large
as the Mediterranean, the one having 801,800 square miles,
and the other 1,675,800 square miles. It has been, therefore,
more difficult to make the larger tributary to the
advance of civilization than the smaller.</p>

<p>North America has entirely taken the palm from South
America in the progress of its culture, just as has uniformly
been the case with all the continents of the northern
hemisphere compared with the southern; and yet
the tropical southern continent is far more profusely endowed
with the gifts of nature than the temperate northern
one. The northern half, on the other hand, enjoys a
far greater advantage in its broken coast-line, numerous
bays, gulfs, islands, peninsulas, harbors, as well as by reason
of its greater want of conformity to a rigid triangular
form.</p>

<p>Enlarging, as it does, toward its southern extremity,
North America approaches a trapezoidal shape, like Asia,
and, as in Asia also, the size of the main body preponderates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
greatly over that of the extremities. Several of
these extremities, too, extend toward the east and south,
and only a few toward the west. To the North American
peninsulas and islands belong the northeasterly island
group of Greenland, (which for centuries was considered
to be a peninsula, but which, since Parry’s discoveries in
1820, has been known to be a group of independent islands,)
Bank’s Land, Boothia Felix, Cockburn, Melville’s Peninsula,
Labrador, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Florida,
the latter 59,000 square miles in area.</p>

<p>The northeast of North America is everywhere much
cut up by inlets of the ocean, larger bays, gulfs, and
sounds. This is the main characteristic of the shore of
the northern United States and Canada. As all these
open toward Europe, the situation of this whole region
has been especially adapted to the most speedy advance
in civilization. The pride of the American can no more
plume itself on an independent progress than can that of
the European; to the former, Europe is the Orient from
which he receives, in an already advanced stage, what the
European receives from Asia, his own Orient.</p>

<p>The less important peninsulas of North America, and
the side most destitute of them, are turned toward the
northern Pacific. To this region belong the Russian possessions,
the desolate wastes of Aliaska, and, farther to the
south, the peninsula of Old California, which has begun,
within the last ten years, to play an active part in the
world’s affairs. But all three of these are capable at
present of little independent advance. They must wait
till they feel the impulse of the civilization of the older
American States, before they take that place to which the
newly-organized commercial relations with China and
Japan seem to be leading the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>North America enjoys a great advantage over Europe
in the possession of large inland lakes or seas. The prevalence
of articulation and of the adjacent islands is not
toward the south, but toward the polar and sub-polar regions,
(from 40° to 50° N. lat.,) as in Europe. And although
many of these islands and peninsulas are as yet
but little known, still the progress of discovery has been
so rapid within the past few years, that it would seem, by
European analogies, that an important history is yet in
store for them. For there is a great kinship between
these northern regions of America and the Scandinavian
and North Russian domains of Europe. And we know
well that no degree of cold has ever intimidated civilization
from penetrating in the latter to the very confines of
the polar world.</p>

<p>As the White Sea, (48,500 square miles in area,) the
Baltic, (167,000 square miles,) and the yet greater North
Sea, have broken through the northern regions of Europe,
so on a far more gigantic scale have the inroads of the
ocean rifted and sundered North America. This we have
learned in our recent frequent voyages to the Esquimaux
regions. Baffin’s Bay, Lancaster Sound, Smith’s Sound,
Jones’ Sound, Barrow Strait, Fox’s Channel with its
uncounted islands, Hudson’s Bay with its 499,000 square
miles of surface, Boothia Gulf, Victoria and Georgia Seas,
Wellington’s Channel, Melville Sound, Prince of Wales
Straits, and very many other water passages and basins
divide those northern districts into a vast mesh of islands
and peninsulas. The superficial area of all these tracts is
on a colossal scale; even the Greenland group is estimated
to include 766,500 square miles. Within the past few
years this whole Arctic Sea has been the scene of numerous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
expeditions of discovery, some of them on a princely
scale.</p>

<p>All this shows that North America is fashioned much
more after the analogy of Europe than of South America.
The analogy would be much more close, if North
America were as favorably affected by climatic conditions
as Europe. Both continents are washed at the south as
well as at the north by great inland seas, and divided up by
them in a manner peculiar to them among all the continents.
Of this articulation, America, less favored by
climate, has much the larger share. By its admirable
harbors, and by the action of the Gulf Stream crossing
the Atlantic in two directions, America has been specially
fitted to receive the population and civilization of
the Old World, and to stand in the closest relations with
it. In this, united with the arrangement of its mountain
chains and the happy characteristics of its river systems,
America bears the palm completely away from Asia. In
that continent the colossal rivers of the north have no
connection at their sources with the head-waters of the
great Chinese, Indian, and West Asiatic rivers. It is entirely
different in North America, where the St. Lawrence,
Mackenzie, Columbia, Colorado, Mississippi, and Missouri
flow from the same region, as from a common center, not
separated at their sources by an immense plateau, but
forming a single river system, from the mouth of one to
that of another, flowing in just the contrary direction.
We find, therefore, that there, as in North Europe, civilization
has followed the water-courses, and has planted colonies
as far north as 70° on the coast of Greenland; while
in Asia human habitations cease with 65° N. lat.</p>

<p>America seems to be appointed, by its physical conditions,
to plant the banner of human progress at the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
northern parts of the globe, and to do for the northern
hemisphere what Great Britain, through her colonies in
Tasmania and South Australia, with their admirable
harbors, is doing for the southern.</p>

<p>Northern Asia seems to have no future indicated for her
beyond the sources and upper courses of her great rivers;
she seems to depend upon Central Asia and upon Russian
Europe for all the scanty culture which she may possess.
In its south and east it seems to have within its Chinese
and Indian populations the seeds of an independent development,
whose results, like those of Arabia, have been
transferred to Europe to become improved there, and then
to be given to the world. The form of the three great
peninsulas, which were the home of Asiatic culture, has
been repeated in Europe,—but with how great a difference!
The three European peninsulas are not in the tropical
zone and near the equator, but are 1400 miles farther
north. The two groups—the eastern one in South Asia,
the western one in South Europe—each consisting of three
peninsulas, are the most valuable auxiliaries the world’s
civilization ever had. Through their agency Asia in the
torrid zone and Europe in the temperate have become
what America and Australia are yet to be to the extreme
north and the extreme south. The former were for the
past, the latter for the present and the future. South
America, and yet much more Africa and Australia, seem
to be held in reserve for the need of a home where the
civilization of centuries yet to come shall expand into perfection.
They now are in their infancy; the day only begins
to break in them. Furnished as they have been with
the most liberal gifts of nature, they must receive a culture
of which we as yet have little conception. In what
way this can be done, the history of the past reveals. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
art of navigation has, within the past three centuries, given
to islands and to continents a new life, and developed relations
unknown till then. The very touch of European
civilization has already wakened the world to new life; and
the oceans, which were once the most impassable of barriers,
have become the closest of bonds to draw the earth
together, and to further its progress toward the consummation
of all history.</p>
